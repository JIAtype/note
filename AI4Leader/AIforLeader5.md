# Interview with Derek Bang
As you watch this interview with Derek Bang (Head of Strategy and Innovation at Crowe) think about how to move from product and service innovation to business model innovation and the resulting ability to scale.  Also, think about the use of automation in Crowe's context and the rules leaders need to follow in this AI and platform model space.

For background on Crowe, take a look at their website, [Crowe.com](https://www.crowe.com/).

Barry Libert 00:09
Hi, I'm Barry Libert. Today I'm here with one of my favorite people, Derek Bang. Who's head
of strategy and innovation at crow, is that correct?
Derek Bang 00:16
That's right.
Barry Libert 00:17
Can you tell me a bit about you again, what it is your job that you do and how you define it?
Derek Bang 00:22
Strategy and innovation is really a broad role. And I often wonder, you know, what comes
first innovation or strategy? Or how do they interrelate. But in essence, it's trying to plan for
what the future is, of our firm of the industry, where we're going, and how do we design the
business around that and make the right investments to make sure that we stay vibrant and
relevant in the years to come.

Barry Libert 00:44
Fantastic. Now, you have some sort of proprietary innovation process, you have a whole
group to that does this?
Derek Bang 00:51
We do have an innovation team that we've been building for, frankly, about 20 years now.
So we have our own roadmap our on processes, our own committees, our own methodology,
our own funding processes to do that, really, from a lot of failure.
Barry Libert 01:06
And in that failure, it seems to me you've done some amazing things. You figured out how to
innovate at scale, which many companies have problems doing.
Derek Bang 01:14
Well, I think the scale is relative. So you know, we've started to scale to a certain level, and
now we're really thinking about how can we scale it, and even bigger level. So, you know,
scale continues to be a challenge, I think, for every organization, but I think it's the right
word to be talking about.
Barry Libert 01:33
So in thinking about what you've done, you begin to go from software to services, right?
You've sort of built a variety of different software capabilities, haven't you?
Derek Bang 01:41
We've built over 60 software applications in the past, I would say, 15 years or so. And we've
learned a lot through that process. So it's been, it's been an adventure, and we're trying to
do it better every day,
Barry Libert 01:58
And you have almost like a whole software group now, don't you?

We have roughly 300 software engineers now at Crowe. And when you think of a
professional services firm saying, well, we have a lot of technology people, oftentimes, that's
consultants implementing other people's technology. But this is a team to actually truly is
building our own technology, we're building our own proprietary tools, and getting patents
and really operating like a tech company.
Barry Libert 02:23
That's spectacular. So when you think about it then it seems to me strategy, then is thinking
about how you might go from product innovation to business model innovation. Because it
sounds like you're building something that is not just a services business, but a really a new
type of business here.
Derek Bang 02:38
Well it comes back to the word "scale". And so, you know, what I learned a long time ago as
an auditor, and then as a consultant was that, you know, the mark, there are vast markets
out there to service. And early in my career, I had an idea for where I saw a large
opportunity where I couldn't scale myself enough to get after and, you know, sort of the
forces of technology, we're coming together to make it affordable to be able to create a
technology tool that could actually scale and solve the problem for an entire market. And
so that's been our, our formula or model is, you know, we work with lots of clients all over
the place, and then we start to see the systemic problems, or we see systemic things that
we do internally. And then we look at, well, we can only, you know, what's easier to scale
with licensing with intellectual property with software code, or by going out and finding
people. And, and obviously, technology is going to be the choice.
Barry Libert 03:32
Spectacular. So now, you're also realizing, if I'm correct, you have a data science group here
now to because you're being well as you can scale, I guess, data is that what you're
thinking?
Derek Bang 03:40
We do, we have a data science team, we have a Chief Data Science Officer. And that really
stemmed from - it's been an evolutionary process. So we started building software
applications. And we started then, you know, growing our client base and scaling that, then
we started to understand while we have access to a lot of data, and we started talking to
the market around what would you like to see? And what would you like to learn from all
B

edX - AI Leadership - Crowe Interview with DerekPBaagneg3 of 6 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
this data that we have access to? Since no one else does... And that sort of naturally led to
who could help us make sense of all of this data. It's not just business intelligence, or
analytics, it's really much larger scale higher thinking activities that you really need to get
people that understand AI and people that understand the possibilities of machine learning
with a rich data set to then open up. So I hired one data scientist and didn't know what I
was going to do with that person. And next thing, you know, we've got 25, and we have a
goal of 50, you know, within three years, so we can't seem to keep them we can't find them
quickly enough.
Barry Libert 04:43
Now, I know you're thinking about something that's important: software and data for your
own capabilities versus software and data as a business capability for others. So maybe
talk a little bit about the difference because that's like a business model question.
Derek Bang 04:56
Sure. When people think about digital transformation, a lot of it's about how do we take
what we're doing today manually, and then you apply technology to it. And we've been
doing that for a long time. In fact, we, we have a group, our software engineering team is
called Applied Technology, we're applying technology to all the different things that we've
been doing. And it's sort of a turning point that came to us to say - Well, if we've got the
same problem, everybody else probably does too. Not just in terms of the markets where
we're already selling technology tools into, but all of the other firms out there that are also
trying to compete in different ways. So it's really an evolutionary step of broadening our
thinking. So when you you mentioned earlier about learning to scale, you know, we scaled
from, you know, human scaling up to starting to using technology to scale what we already
do now, it's thinking about scaling and industry.
Barry Libert 05:48
Wow. And you're also thinking about autonomous now, autonomy? Am I correct? You're
thinking about how do I go from software and data to some sort of autonomous theory for
the industry?
Derek Bang 05:58
Well, you know, autonomous is the buzzword today of autonomous cars and autonomous
this and autonomous that, so, you know, I don't want to oversell, you know what we're
thinking there. But there is the concept of really freeing up people from mundane and
B
D

edX - AI Leadership - Crowe Interview with DerekPBaagneg4 of 6 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
traditional human power tasks, allow them to do something at a higher level. And within
professional services, there's just a tremendous amount of mundane rote things that people
don't enjoy doing that, you know, that are still complicated, not very complex, but
complicated and have a lot of risk as well. And they're expensive to do, so autonomy seems
to be that evolution of super charging the professional services industry.
Barry Libert 06:43
Fantastic. So tell me, for people who want to become AI leaders like you and want to build
platforms and networks, what are some of the rules that they need to consider in this very
difficult transition? Because obviously, you've been doing this for a while you've been
thinking about it, you're ahead of the curve. So what would you tell leaders who want to be
thinking this way?
Derek Bang 06:59
Sure. Well, you have to have data to start with. So what is your data strategy? And where
are you going to find data, you know, obviously, there has to be a market for whatever
you're doing. So having AI technology, just for the sake of having AI technology is going to
be a very expensive waste of time and effort. So you have to have a market, you have to
have data, and then you have to have people that understand what the possibilities are,
and ultimately, what's your business model behind that. So not just dive into it, saying, I
need AI for the sake of AI, that's going to be a really important component of the future
digital business strategy. But it's got to be coupled with the market needs, the data you
have access to, or can get access to, and the business model you design around.
Barry Libert 07:44
And how about dealing with boards and management teams, there's, there's a lot of
change management of this process seems like you've been toward a number of changes in
this journey.
Derek Bang 07:51
Not easy, not easy. But I think that a lot of organizations, whether that's at the board level,
or the executive or management level, are starting to really understand that there's more
risk of doing nothing, then there is making some of these investments in technology. So
we've understood that for a long time. But it's getting to be another level of fear of
extinction. Fear, you know, fear is a great motivator and I'm starting to see that a lot more
in the boardroom, within management teams out there, of, we're going to have to respond

in some way, shape or form, which is going to start with funding it's going to start with the
strategy is going to start with networks. And I think there's a greater appetite than I've ever
seen before.
Barry Libert 08:39
Fantastic, but you're also involved with an educational institution as well, aren't you?
Derek Bang 08:43
I work actively with the Kelley School Business and Indiana University.
Barry Libert 08:47
And are you seeing the same sort of thing and education that they're being to think about
different ways of building their business models? Is it just professional services? Is it all
industries?
Derek Bang 08:56
I think it's every industry, whether you look at what the Kelley School's done online with
Kelley Direct some of the different programs they're exploring. We've seen it with many
other universities out there that are either going to make the move to digital or there'll be
the very top programs that will probably survive off reputation alone. There'll be the low
end of the market and there won't be much in the middle.
Barry Libert 09:16
Wow, it's an amazing thought. I want to thank you so much for being on today, I'm hoping
the rest of the leaders can follow your lead. You are an amazing guy.
Derek Bang 09:22
Thank you Barry. It's been a pleasure.

# Module 5: Capstone Project, Incomplete section

# 5.1.1.Video: Building Your Business Case Capstone
Now that you've completed the journey towards platforms, AI, and data, you understand most,
if not all the components.
But I wanted to recap for you in this capstone project, how to think about it.
So we're going to think about how to design your autonomous business unit and AI powered
platform.
And we're gonna talk about three primary rules for success: one is thoughts, the second is
jumping curves, and the third is about who.
And last we're going to conclude with the 10 components of business model success.
Remembering all of us that we went through the pivot journey: pinpoint, inventory, validate,
operate, organized and transform your organization.
But the important part I want to leave us with is one, thought action and outcomes are
related.
And this is critically important, Your beliefs become your thoughts, your thoughts become
your words, words become actions, actions become habits, habits become values.
And values become destiny," And for all of our companies that all of our investments
we find that our leaders and board beliefs become their organizations, destinies.
And I wanted to tell you that you get through this journey, you will have to examine your
beliefs before you could ever change your destiny.
And number two is you're going to have to cross the chasm of value making products and
making services are yesterday's business model, tomorrow's business model are about platforms,
networks and AI powered organizations and crossing that chasm is critically important.
You can't get stuck in the product service economy.
Everybody can make a product and service very few people can do platforms that works in
AI well.
Third, where you're thinking about this you have to measure where you're going and that
is not just what you're doing with why and why you're starting with why but who you're
going to have on the bus and that's critically important.
Because without the right people on the bus, even if you have the right "why" you will
never get there.
So the 10 components I want you all to remember with is to remember that you have to build
a business plan.
A completely new autonomous business plan, with an executive summary, a background about
the size, the market, your plan, your unique offerings, your go to market strategy and
a brand new revenue model, a whole new team with organizational capabilities, a timeline,
capital requirements, how are you going to use the source of funds and next steps.
But, and here's the but, as we started this journey, remember, it's about you.
It's about the selfie economy.
It's about the ability to be present in today's world, thinking about how you serve others
and how other serve you and we want to leave you with the same thought.
Thank you for joining us on this journey.
We really appreciate your time and best of luck tool.
