Barry Libert 00:09
Hi, Barry Libert here again today with Chip McLean, one of my favorite firmwide strategy
guys from Crowe.
Chip McLean 00:16
Good to see you Barry.
Barry Libert 00:17
Thanks we're happy to have you here today. So tell me a little bit about what your job is and
what is it that you do every day as part of the firm wide strategy practice?
Chip McLean 00:25
So I get to work with all the business unit leaders and their teams and vertical industry
leaders and help them think more deeply about how do we add value to our clients.

Barry Libert 00:37
And what does that mean, in English?
Chip McLean 00:40
It means we get together, we lock ourselves in rooms, and we think about what our current
business models are, and what types of things we can look at to change those business
models to add more value to help our clients make smarter decisions.
Barry Libert 00:57
Fantastic. So you and I started a process but six months ago called pivot sort of interesting
beginning. And can you take me through what you did in terms of pivot, pinpoint inventory,
validate, organized and transfers? Let me start from the beginning with the first thing you
did and I think we had an offsite meeting and you were sort of building a presentation
about how to pinpoint one's mental model, what was what's your thesis out, people should
think about that?
Chip McLean 01:24
Well, there's a challenge that you start with and that is that we've been living in business
models, you know, for a long time. And we operate within those business models. And in
order to pivot your business, you have to change the way you look at things, which is super
hard, because all of your strategy and innovation has been geared towards working within a
given business model. So people are, I don't want to say closed minded but very myopic on
how do we add value to our customers. So you you've gotta, you gotta throw a lot of that
stuff out and look at things with more of a broader lens.
Barry Libert 02:06
And you have this analogy about "seeing the stars". So maybe you can come a little bit
what you did, and how you did that, at that event.
Chip McLean 02:12
Okay, so I saw a TED talk a long time ago, and I can't even remember who delivered it. But
there's a there's a quote by Marcel Proust, that says, "the real voyage of discovery, not
seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes,". So I'm like, that's really relevant to this
whole journey that you're going to go on to pivot. And so the story I tell us, if we go out and
look at the night sky by ourselves, and we know nothing about the sky will look at it and go,
B

AI Leadership - Crowe Interview - Chip McLean.mPpa4ge 2 of 5 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
oh, they're stars. But if we go out and look at the sky with a telescope will see more than we
could see with the naked eye. And then a third way to look at it is what if I had an
astronomer with me they have more perspective. So the reality is, we all have our own point
of view, in order to advance our business model in our thinking, we have to expand our own
point of view... and that only comes from really being open to doing that.
Barry Libert 03:14
Great. And then we moved in something i thought was a great exercise you did on the
board, we sort of did an inventory to see what we could do in this firm. And I think we had
some real surprises, if I remember correctly, in terms of what we learned.
Chip McLean 03:26
Yeah, yeah, I think, you know, businesses evolve over time. And many things are done very
intentionally, but a lot of it is to meet a current business needs. So you, you evolve over time.
But we did an inventory of all of the technology solutions that we have available today. And
we ended up with, it was over 60 different sticky notes on the wall that represented all the
technologies and, and we stuck, we stepped back and there was this huge aha moment,
because we could physically see see the chaos of the journey we've been on. And so, okay,
so here's where we're at today. But the reality is, how do we support that and an ongoing
basis, and you start to look at the resources required, the, you know, just to keep the
technology up to date, everything, and we're like, oh, my gosh, this isn't this is not a
sustainable model, which is why we started working with you is to start thinking about, you
know, how can we create a common platform and leverage the relationships we have, and
ultimately bring artificial intelligence to, you know, all this amazing data and stuff that we
have to help our clients make better decision.
Barry Libert 04:46
And you also did an inventory, if I remember correctly on data, what did we find there?
Chip McLean 04:52
The same thing - I mean, we have a bunch of structured we have a bunch of unstructured
data that lives in, way too many places, and it's it's unmanageable, right? It's, we can't
harness the value in that data, because it's, we had no real data strategy. You might have a
data strategy for a solution, but maybe you're in a vertical with 10 solutions. Without a
common data strategy, you can't leverage the value that you have there. So we're in the
same same boat with data,

AI Leadership - Crowe Interview - Chip McLean.mPpa4ge 3 of 5 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
Barry Libert 05:27
Fantastic. At least we learned that, I think that was an "aha" for, I remember that day for
everybody in the room. Now, we've moved on from that period of time, you guys moved into
validation faster than any client I've ever seen. And what, how did you begin to think, oh,
gosh, I have to build a business model proposal to the board to validate that we have
something that that there's a "there there" here at Crowe?
Chip McLean 05:50
So that whole validation processes is, it's an education process, right? So you people, you
know, that haven't been on that journey with us now have to, to be able to see it in a
manner that shows that it's necessary for sustainability for the organization. But we brought
up - we have a team of 15 people that represent different facets of the firm. And we're
working on thinking about the new business model trying to validate it, we're looking at
data, we're looking at governance, we're looking at how do you, you know, take a
technology that's deployed and move it onto a platform? So all of this is part of that whole
validation process. It's answering all the questions that need to be answered before you
move to finally operationalizing going to platforms, networks and AI.
Barry Libert 06:55
And it's so cool. We started with probably 40 people in the room in the first meeting when
we, when we first started 50 people? We're down now to like a dozen, I noticed, we really
are beginning to organize a team now. Can you tell me what the different types of skills that
are emerging on this team to make it a full team?
Chip McLean 07:10
Oh, my gosh, yeah, we have everything from data scientist to software architecture type
thinking, to marketing people, to our Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, to people that
have been on our innovation teams to help us better understand the technologies that we
have out there, and the value they provide. And so it's a pretty diverse team that have
amazing amounts of experience in the stuff that we've been doing thus far. But also people
that can think about how do we transform the business to move to live in this world that we
live in.
Barry Libert 07:57
The last thing is transforming the business. It seems to me there's two pivots going on in this
firm. One is transforming the firm as it is to be more efficient, and one is creating a brand
B
C
B
C

AI Leadership - Crowe Interview - Chip McLean.mPpa4ge 4 of 5 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
new pivot model, which is a brand new business in and of itself. Can you explain to me those
two very different activities, why they're different, and how you're experiencing it differently,
in fact.
Chip McLean 08:22
So based on what I've experienced less far, would say that there's still huge value in what we
do in our traditional business model. That's never going to go away I mean never is a long
time, but we might be providing higher value as a result of some of the things will be doing
in the new business model. So there's some things that happen where, you know, you have
to anticipate making that change is hard, and not everyone's going to be completely
accepting of that and understanding of it. So there's an effort there to really effectively
educate that a traditional business model and then on the new business model pivot -
because you're really asking me about the two pivots that are happening, right? So you
have to pivot the traditional business model to think about how do we coexist in what
values do we bring to each other. And then on the on the new business model, it's a massive
pivot. On paper, it seems logical and easy, but there's so many things that have to change,
starting with mindset and how you develop solutions and in how you leverage data and how
you take things to the new world of AI. AI be the new electricity, right?
Barry Libert 10:02
Yep. Fantastic. Thanks so much. Thanks for being with me today.
Chip McLean 10:05
Alright, thanks, Barry.
Barry Libert 10:06
Appreciate it.

# 4.1.1.Video: Pinpoint

So let's get started. Let's think about for a second as we begin our journey
into pivot, the first one, pinpoint and understand where did we come from. So, as
we talked about in the beginning with Megan, the objective in today's world is
to achieve my needs. To be immediate, easy, personal, sharable and independent. Now, I
don't look like Selena Gomez nor am I as attractive or as well known, but it's
still the same. I want to have all those same capabilities, objectives met, needs
covered and to do that I need to be part of and want to be part of the gig
economy which is a company like upwork where I can get immediate, easy, personal
sharable and independent work where I can move around my money like with
wealthfront and betterment and where I can ultimately be part of a company that
understands the components of success which includes producers, consumers, data IA
and a user interface that is easy, ready, available and enables me to
achieve my goals. So as we think about each of these things, we can see why
today's most valuable companies have moved from the days of GE and GM and
Exxon which are hard, heavy, slow moving companies to today's light organizations
like Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Tencent and Alibaba where everything is
about the consumer, the partner, the partner and provider and those companies
that understand these frictionless platforms are worth upwards of a
trillion dollars and serve not one million customers, but a billion
customers and so therefore the old product service economy sits in the red
ocean whereas today's platforms, AI and data based businesses set in the blue
ocean and we need to help every one of you make the case to your leaders that
it's time to move from red ocean to blue ocean, so let's get started.
To begin with, I want to be clear what we've learned and all of our work with
boards and leaders is that the really hard thing to do is to change one
leader's or board's thinking. As Einstein once said, to break a mental model is
more difficult than literally splitting an atom and that really tells you about
the journey you're about to go on, So to recant, what has happened is we've
talked to you about the five business models: physical, human, intellectual, money
and platform and the economics of each of them so I want to spend a minute
again repeating that this is about money. It's about producing more economics for
your organization as a leader as a vice president as a director by understanding
the economics of the journey, not just the goodness of being an AI driven
platform because when it's all said and done you will need money to make this
transition and transformation, so the numbers are what you need to be able to
tell. And, you need be able to tell why this is the future for your organization.
If you're a manufacturer, which is the oldest business model if you're a
services firm which is still fairly old or even a financial services firm, you
need to move up the curve to the digital world and platform world and you will be
compensated for that. Now, as we think about it in the physical world remember
it's me making something like the chair you're sitting in and selling it to
somebody, someone who else wants to sit in a chair. In the services world, about
me selling time I'm an ex McKinsey consultant Megan's from Bain, Thomas
Accenture. We sold hours and those hours got sold one to one. In the money world, I
make something many people can use, it it's called In God We Trust, which is on
our dollar bills, but in the platform in digital we make something once many
people can participate in like Apple iOS and many people can contribute to it.
So, as you think about where you are, think about are you on the left side of
this which means are you somebody an organization
that makes something and sells it to an organization as a one-sided exchange or
are you part of the new economy, the AI platform and data economy where multiple
parties are contributing multiple sources of value to an organization that
is you, that is convening. And when you think about that, I'm going to ask you a
question in this actionable part of this course is very simply what is the gap
for your organization between a product service mental and business model that
you have today and a platform AI and data based business model that is
multi-sided, has machine learning at the center and as Megan said curates,
understands and protects the value of the data as the core premise of what you
do every day.

# 4.2.1.Video: Inventory
In this module, we're gonna look at inventory. We're gonna try to understand
what it is you currently keep track of and what it is you need to keep track of
in the platform, AI and data worlds. Now there's a high probability that there is
a very large gap between where you are and where we want you to go, but that gap
is really blue sky for you, as this picture shows. As I look and walk around
organizations, I say to every firm and board I work for, there is data strewn
throughout every organization on the floor. Customer data, employee data,
inventory data, you name it. Sentiment data, engagement data and it's
sitting all over the place but the problem is that organizations have not
valued that data, they've only valued the fundamental data of an organization. The
financial data, the manufacturing data, the productivity data of the
organization, so we're gonna try to cross the chasm and this is a big chasm for
most organizations as they look to inventory what is truly valuable as
Megan has showed in today's intangible and alternative data world. So let's
start again with where Megan left us off. We all know, because our CFO's, our chief
financial offers have been the keeper of money and things, it's now time for us to
look abroad and say where is other sources of data. So it's possible that we
think about, okay, does the HR person have people data, benefits data, engagement
data, training data, educational data, insights data about the people and
suppliers with which we work that allows us to better serve them against which we
can apply machines to improve their lives. On the other side, do we have
through our chief marketing officer network data, that is social network data,
marketing data, social responsibility data even investor reports and investor
data because they're part of our external networks. And are we collecting
from sensors IOT data, because that's external to our current internal
network and for an educational organization, do we have data regarding
our families whose service them, we serve, their children, their parents, the funders.
Do we think about that broadly and from a technology spectrum, do we have
intellectual property data like brand data, software data, patent data, you name
it. R&D investment data that shows the type of intellectual property that we
are producing. As we think about all those alternative data sets, we have to
think who owns it who's responsible for we know in the finance department who
owns that data set but do we really know who owns the data sets that we just
talked about is there somebody in our organization that we can go to to
understand what data they have what data they could and can collect and how can
that be governed in such a way it presents and delivers value for the
organization. And to do that, we need to think, okay, we need to take a data
inventory and we need you to go to the natural person in our organization that
has been the keeper of those relationships. Doesn't mean they've been
the keeper of the data sets, but they've been the keeper of those network-based
relationship marketers, HR department, production departments technology
departments and we need to understand what is the cost of not knowing. Think
about this way, there was a quality movement right Deming realized that the
cost of not knowing the quality of data for Ford or the quality of a car
produced by Ford when Ford became a simple mission on quality as job number
one is they realized that the cost of not knowing the quality of what they
produced created a lack of customer desirability, a lack of customer loyalty,
so they realized they had to know what type of car they were producing and the
quality of that car they were producing so they can maintain customers, make sure
they were satisfied and cars were now brought back into warranty, well
the same thing goes for data. Can you imagine 10 years ago, today,
you had to drive to your local educational institution or you had to go pay
a bill, or you had to go downtown and you didn't know how to get there and by
chance Google decided 'I'm taking away GPS'. You'll love to just figure out your
way there and there's no more Maps anymore,
you'd have to navigate a long way without knowing where you're going. Well,
that's the truth for organizations too. They're navigating in a not knowing way
they've not thought wow what is the cost of not knowing the GPS of our strategy,
the GPS of our customer directions, the GPS of our employees wants and needs, the
GPS of our Investor requirements. That cost is very high, so it's necessary to
do a cost-benefit analysis of not knowing versus knowing. Once you
understand that you can do the next thing under inventory, you can do
something as simple a plot like this what is available and what
can I value immediately, and in the low bottom left corner you can think, well
I've got some easy to obtain information with low impact, but what I really want
to have is hard to access information with high impact. So, how do I do that
around intellectual property? how do I do that around customers and employees and
how do I do it around brands and friendships and fans so that I could begin
to move my business from easy to access not very valuable data
to high value, high-impact, hard to access data and to make that the core of what
we do ,and that could be applications software data regarding brands, you name
it. But data is the core of what it is you're going to do around every aspect
of your business in this inventory part of our activities.

# 4.2.3.Inventory
Take an inventory of some of your organizations under-measured intangible assets.  Consider both internal assets, and external assets that you may be able to access easily or through partnerships.  The goal of this step is to understand alternative assets that you may be able to leverage into a new strategy.

# 4.3.1.Video: Validate
In this third module, we're going to talk about validation. You will have to make a
business case for capital investment, in your initiative to make the case that AI
data and platform business models are your future and the only can do that is
building a business case for capital and capabilities, talent and team to ensure
your value is being delivered. As we look back over time, we can see two very
different business model cases GE versus Amazon and it's clear that GE has lost
its way, they've gone through multiple CEOs that have tried to stem the red
ink of their business while Amazon is invested in the future. You can see that
plugging a dike of traditional business balls just does not work so as you look
forward think more about Apple and Steve Jobs, He used to constantly say I want 50% of
my revenues in five years to come from products and services
I don't offer today and if you look back, there used to be a hardware company
right, but you think about the fact they built a network using their phone of iOS
developers that build apps that now generate more than 35 billion dollars a
year. In itself, just that app business would be part of the fortune 500 and now
they become a full platform business, allowing multiple to develop multiple
products including healthcare products in their environment. So they went from a
hardware company to a data company to a network company to a full platform. That
transition can be done by every organization including yours, but you
need to build a business case for your board and if you remember the leadership
team, you need to get everybody on board. So how do you get started. You need to
look at where you are, the current state and you need to build a desired State.
You need to be able to show what the gap is in the economics and the competencies
and the structures and the strategies of today's business model that you are
currently operating, selling things offering services,
to tomorrow's business day where your customers your employees your partners
are part of a two-sided revenue model where data, analytics and AI sit the
centerpiece of that and that gap normally is huge according to our
research but not insurmountable. And as we've learned, we should look at small
little steps in getting there, but building the gap analysis to show how
much value in this journey is going to be generated is critical to your
leadership team. So to do that, what I would suggest you do is look at a
variety of parts of the business. Start with simple things like the clock speed,
what is the clock speed of your organization is it slow in years like
from manufacturing? Is it slow in hours like 2000 billable hours for consultants?
Is it fast, has it got a bi-monthly download like software companies that are
downloading constantly to my phone or is it milliseconds like it is in the
platform economy or as we've seen the amount of downloads by its network are
massive. How about of a competency perspective? Do you have the skills and capabilitie?
Is your firm made up of people who do things, make things, run around and
carry things really like Masons and carpenters, or is it made up of service
professionals like consultants, like myself, a McKinsey, Bain or BCG, Deloitte
or KPMG. Does it have tomorrow's and today's competency's of software engineers
and data architects or does it really have what we really need is automation
and AI and machine learning people who understand data science. Each of those
skill sets are different and even though software engineers sound like same as
architects and physical engineers that build buildings, their skill sets are
dramatically different. How about the capital growth? Is your capital made
up of bonds and debt which is traditional of older style organizations?
Will you pay a dividend to like a utility or are you made up of self-funded
growth which are services firms because your earnings driven you know, your
profits produce your economic growth. Or, are you growth capital do you have
private equity that supports the tech business
or you venture backed even for part of your business those venture-backed parts of
your business like Ford or GM are doing Ford for Agro and GM with Vision are
using venture based capital to grow their business, even though their
old businesses are backed by utility and old-style
investors who want dividends, their new businesses are backed by different types
of investors who want to see them propelled into the future. So, you need to
think about the entire landscape of your organization. From the clock speed to the
capital and competencies to your capabilities for the future. You're gonna
need to build a business model canvas. I would not suggest you build one based on
the traditional business model canvas, it's based on a one-sided business model.
I make something and sell it to somebody else. I would really suggest you think
about a multi-sided business model, like the one we've presented, which has consumers and
producers, company, data AI and a user interface along with partners and to
think about each of their value propositions as you build your business
case to the leaders so that you are well enough funded so you can transform your
organization and/or build today's business model.

# 4.3.3.Validate
The purpose of Validate is to build out and begin testing a business plan that leverages a platform strategy.

Building a business plan is an iterative process.  Consider how you can combine your organizations data and IP with internal or external networks to create a two-sided revenue model.  Begin by brainstorming the right combination of data, producers, and consumers.  Focus more on value than on revenue.  Then, begin layering on potential revenue models, which may involve a third group: Partners.  After you brainstorm, pick one model to focus on and answer the following questions.

# 4.4.1.Video: Organize
In this section, we talk about people, and organization and operations because
we're gonna have to operationalize the concept that we're going to become a
platform AI and data-driven model and in doing that we have to change our
thoughts right, our thoughts drive our actions and in this case we have to
accept the reality that we're living in the Selfie economy where our customers
want what they want, our investors want what they want, our employees want what
they want, no one really cares what we want anymore as the company leaders. We
have to put ourselves in their shoes so if you think who are we gonna put in
charge of this brand-new initiative that is orthogonal or different and moving in
a different way with a different mental model than we have in our firm, right.
Think about it from an educational institution. We're gonna let the students
drive the curriculum, how crazy is that. But the bottom line is we need to accept
that reality, so the people we want to put there are the people who are crazy
enough to believe they can do it and who can believe they can change the world
and that means our world with it. So we need a small team of people that are
proactive and they're in every organization. They exist in your firm,
they want to do something different. So as leaders, you need to embrace these new
young leaders and say go do it go find your teammates. Make sure it's a
fully skilled team, you need a marketer, you need data scientists, you need data
technologists, machine learning professionals, you need finance, you need
organizational skills, build a new complete comprehensive team. It doesn't
really need more than five people. It needs finance, marketing, tech and data science.
You need five it's like a small basketball team and when you do that you
need to be able to say what is the action plan,
what's the template we're gonna use that describes every action that each of us
are going to take? What's the data plan that we're gonna go get and use to
acquire the alternative data, what is our intellectual thesis about what we're
gonna do that is different than other people are going to do?
What is the machine learning applications and algorithms we're gonna
go build and who we gonna serve with them. Is it gonna be focused on employees,
focused on customers, is it focused on investors. Lastly, what is
the financing plan, and across all of those what is the timeline for that. Now,
that won't be sufficient unless you can convince these people that this is what
we need to accomplish. Now, it won't be an easy task because if they could have
done it they would have done it already so you need to speak to them in their
language. You want to say this is the team we need to get it done and we will
get it done quickly and efficiently and this is the return that you will achieve
by letting us go in this direction with this idea that has been proven already
among unicorns and Companies that are worth a trillion dollars so give us a
little rope, give us a chance and time and we will deliver it, and then you need to
act like a startup organization. In stealth, thinking about the products,
ideas, planning, team work that you're going to use to get your first
referenceable customers to prove to your company that customers that you already
have, want this new way of being. It's no different than Blackrock starting
Aladdin with their Board of advisors or Schwab doing the same thing with a
Schwab Intelligent Advisor. Each of those organizations understood that you had to
insulate their new teams to deliver the products of tomorrow.

# 4.5.1.Video: Track
In this last module, we're gonna talk about track and transform because as we've
talked about from the very beginning: pinpoint, inventory, validate, organize
and operate and track now, we're gonna talk about how to transform your
organization by tracking your progress and performance in this movement of the
entire organization towards a platform AI and data-driven world. Think about
this again, Apple and then thereafter, Amazon became the first and second US
companies with one trillion dollar market caps now what made them unique is
they understood something that Jeff Bezos talks about all the time. It's
called first day thinking. First day thinking as he says, is about the
customer starting with the beginning or the first day of startup, thinking the
customer is really the center of the wants and needs of your business but he
also goes on to say that every company after they get funding becomes a second
day company, which means they forget about the customer, they forget about the
student, they forget about the patient, they become focused on themselves and
how to improve themselves. That's not the thesis we're talking about here. We're
talking about becoming a platform, which is a two-sided model focused on the periphery
of the organization using data and AI to enable the selfies of our world, the
customers, employees, investors of our world to achieve their goals, not ours
and in the process we will achieve ours. Therefore we can Amazon ourself in
doing this. If you think about it, I have a friend who invested if you can believe
this $15 at the IPO in 1994 that $15 is now worth $500,000 and at a recent visit
to Apple store, they said Barry you should have spent those tens of
thousands of dollars on Apple stock and bought Apple products and you'd be worth
tens of millions of dollars. So you need to think that way. How am I gonna Amazon
myself and build a two-sided business model and achieve these great outcomes.
Well to do that, I want you to think the following. How am I
going to think which business am I and what am i tracking? What are the KPIs
that I'm using, that's the important thing. You will manage what you measure
and that we've seen in every board and every management team. So if you're
managing and measuring units produced in your car manufacturer, then you will make
cars. If you're managing billable hours in your consulting firm like 2200
billable hours, you will sell services. If you're managing downloads and the amount
of customer subscriptions, you will build software and if you're managing the size
of the network and the amount of data being generated, you will build a
platform and if you're managing money under management or AUM, you will build a
financial services firm. But, that doesn't work. Today, we need to understand all the
dimensions of measurement. We need to build KPIs or key performance indicators
on each thing. What we make, because Amazon does build Alexas, that's unit
produced. Apple does make phones. We need to keep track of the number of people
that develop stuff for us, like Apple iOS, the number of developers and the number
of people. We need to measure the amount of software we develop, the amount of
intellectual property we create and we need to manage that and we need to, for
the first time, understand the engagement, the sentiment, the participation of our
networks. If we don't, we won't have a network. Think of it this way, there is no
way that Facebook could have 2.5 billion customers, and this is the good part,
doing all the work for them for free. Posting, reviewing, sharing, sharing my
friends, my resume, I do it all for free. It's amazing. They would never do that if
they'd not kept track of that now here's the point, they couldn't have done it if
you, whoever you are, and your company didn't care about customers because you
can't build a business with 2.5 billion customers if every one of those
customers were loved and cared for, so businesses lost the perspective to prove
Jeff Bezos's point that a first day thinking organization
keeps track of loves, not just likes, like Facebook says but loves their customers
so their customers can love them back. It goes beyond the thesis of liking. Liking
is no longer sufficient, customer satisfaction doesn't even matter anymore
we must move to customer and employee and investor love and measure it and we
must measure it across a period of time and track the performance of that period
of time to see where that we're improving,
degrading in changing the way the network is engaging with us, the amount
of Technology and software we're delivering, the amount of data we're
producing so we can understand every component of our business, not just the
unit's produced or the hours generated. So in this module, we've looked at track
and understanding the performance and progress measures that you all need to
keep track of your progress and your performance and to be able to report
back to your board and to your management team how you are going on a
different course, an exponential course, that will allow your organization to
transcend its incrementalism, its optimization approach that they've had
to business to a brand new approach using platforms AI and data and a brand
new set of measures against which you can be managed, reported and measured
against.

The goal of Track is to measure what matters for your new initiative—and this will require different KPIs than the rest of the organization.

# 4.6.Video: Wrap Up: Changing Strategies, Cultures, and Processes— A 5 Step Approach
Overall, we've covered a variety of things today, why you should transform how you should
transform, and what you need to do.
Pivot is about what you need to do.
It's getting down to the nitty gritty.
Under pinpoint, you need to organize your team as an off site and understand your management
team and board and where they are.
You then need to have a small team, a team of inventory professionals, analysts that
can inventory all of your data, all of your networks all of your intangible assets.
You then need a financial team that will lie to build a business case for the board and
management team so you can get some capital to make it real.
You then need to organize a small team to operationalize it and then you need to build
under track a new set of KPIs to ensure your success so that you are not measured against
the traditional KPIs of your more established incumbent organization.
