# 介绍语-视频内容

We all know how hard it is in today's world to keep up with trillion dollar businesses
and billion dollar unicorns that are using platforms, networks and AI to win.
So our journey is to help you, the leaders of incumbent organizations prosper - to teach
your team, to up-skill your organization around the primary AI and digital journeys that all
of us may go through and have to go through to ensure our global and local success.
AI-driven organizations typically want to explore a wide variety of technologies, and
leaders and boards are necessary to buy in, to ensure that their breadth and depth are
applied throughout the organization for success.
We’ll also cover the seven primary steps leaders
need to consider, when they are becoming AI-Driven organizations.
In this segment we’ll describe the different types of AI technology and discuss how they
are used in platform-based models.
The leaders of AI and platform-driven organizations know that data is their most important asset,
where it used to be money and things, it is now the quality of data that can support AI,
especially as you and I create reams of it.
Today, as organizations are shifting from tangible physical assets into intangibles,
new data sources are a key part of the equation.
This requires alternative data--data sources that move beyond the standard financial metrics
that most companies focus on and report every day.
To successfully use data and AI in a differentiated way, companies must create a unique approach
and identify the right sources of data, both internal and external, for alternative data
to support that approach for value is once again being originated by you and I’s manufacturers
of the data.
And although machine learning and artificial intelligence seem complicated, the difficult
part is actually finding, cleaning, and using the data.
In other words, AI-driven leaders need to start now, and understand the sources of energy
which is data, in today’s AI world.
We’ll describe the characteristics and structure and strategies of platform organizations.
We will provide a number of examples of both encumbrance as well as startup organizations
and explain why existing organizations find it challenging to transform their product
and service based businesses to platform network and AI organizations.
We will also include economics are a key piece of the value proposition, showing you the
justification for your leadership team and a board about why transformation to these
new business models focused on us is required.
We will finally discuss how data and artificial intelligence have become essential components
to the platform business model, and what this means for organizations like you, as you seek
to adopt one.
Last we will move to module 4, where we will take a look at changing strategies, cultures,
and structures through a 5 step process and approach we call pivot.
This stands for pinpoint, inventory, validate organize and transform.
Specifically, we will cover each of this components starting with pinpoint, which identifies the
gap between likely, your organization’s business model, and today’s most valuable
platform and driven businesses.
We will hope you inventory your company’s intangible assets including customer data,
employee sentiment and engagement, product insights, manufacturing, available knowledge
sets and building a business case, for the valuation of your new transform of organization
to your board, or leadership team.
We’ll then help you think about organizing a small team to make your transformation real,
and finally we’ll help you think about the KPI’s, the reporting instruments that's
going to measure your progress and your performance.
We will conclude with a capstone case using each student’s organization as a case study
to be prepared by them as a means to show you and your team how you can become a platform
AI and data driven organization and in that case, become the great organization that you
want to be.
So let’s get started.
Have a great time, learn a lot, and enjoy the journey.

# 模块说明-文档

Introduction: We will provide an overview of the four primary sections of this course as well as the learning objectives and the key take-aways for the learners. Our objective: To help executives become masters of today’s most valuable and scalable technologies and business models and what to do to implement them in their organizations.

Module 1: Machines and Artificial Intelligence) --This segment addresses what AI is and does. AI is not just one technology, but many—each with its own application types, stage of development, strengths, and limitations. Some, like robotic process automation, are relatively easy to implement (even for non-IT people) and provide rapid ROI. Others, like deep learning neural networks, are much more complex and cutting-edge, and require high levels of expertise. AI-driven organizations typically want to explore a wide variety of technologies, and leaders are necessary to ensure that breadth and to weigh in on which ones might be most critical to their organization’s success. A survey that Deloitte conducted last year of U.S. executives with a high level of AI awareness found that “managers don’t understand cognitive technologies and how they work” was rated as the primary AI challenge by 37% of the respondents, so this trait is often not found when it’s needed. In this segment we’ll describe the different types of AI technology and discuss how they are used in platform-based models.

Module 2: Data (both internal and external)—AI driven platform leaders know that data is their most important asset if they want to do substantial work in AI. High-quality internal and external data is critical to many business models and services. If you’re planning, for example, to use machine learning to predict what your customers will buy under what circumstances, you need high-quality data on what different types of customers have bought in the past. Or if you’re a health care organization wanting to use deep learning models to analyze medical images, you need a lot of images with labeled outcomes from which the system can learn. Many organizations turn to external data to augment their internal sources. And some firms need to improve data quality and integration before the can use it with their AI projects. In other words, AI-driven leaders need to start now, if not yesterday, to improve their data.

Module 3: Platforms and Networks—The first session will be devoted to what platforms offer and deliver. We’ll describe platforms in general, provide a number of examples, and describe the benefits of platforms in terms of growth and valuation. We will then discuss the design of a platform-based business. It’s important to have clear objectives for what kind of platform businesses create, what data it will generate, and what it will do with AI to extract actionable insights from the data. What products and services will your platform offer? What kinds of customers will you serve? If you have an existing business, how will you evolve it in the direction of a platform-enabled business model?

Module 4: Changing Strategies, Cultures, and Processes— A 5 Step Approach. AI driven, platform leaders recognize that preparing their people for AI and platforms is just as important as preparing the technology and data. Platform business models driven by data and AI are still relatively recent in business history, and the ways in which platform business models can be grown and scaled are still being understood. Particularly in companies based on traditional models, the transition to PDA models can be difficult if undertaken in one large “moon shot.” The alternative is to undertake a series of less ambitious projects—what we call “low hanging fruit.” While less transformational individually, a series of such projects can add up to major change. Even at Amazon, one of the most technologically sophisticated PDA in the world, adopting the platform model and making extensive use of AI took many years. CEO Jeff Bezos noted in his 2017 letter to shareholders that while the company undertakes some highly ambitious projects like intelligent drones, the bulk of its machine learning efforts are devoted to “quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.” We generally feel that most companies will be better off with a series of less ambitious projects. In this segment we discuss how organizations can transition to the PDA model and bring about the needed organizational changes. Leaders will need to work together in PDA organizations to establish priorities, determine the implications for technology architectures and human skills, and assess the implications for key functions like marketing and supply chain. This section will focus on the 10 step process every organization and their leader can use to insure their success and future growth and value.

Module 5: We will conclude with a capstone case using each student’s organization as a case study to be prepared by them as a means to show how their organizations can become Platform, AI and data driven and the business case to get there.

Today’s companies and investors are all starting to evaluate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will either positively or negatively impact their organization’s growth, profits and overall returns.   

According to Research from the World Economic Forum (WEF) and McKinsey, AI will increasingly disrupt what we do, who does it and how all work is done as pieces of human work are transferred to machines. On the positive side, AI is expected to add significant growth and value to the world’s economy for the companies and countries that develop it.  As such, it is more important than ever that all leaders, managers, executives and board members develop their AI skills to compete and prosper in the AI world.  

However, most leaders of organizations and investors in companies don’t have the requisite skills to use these technologies to create competitive advantage, nor to build the right teams to insure their long term success.   As such, this course will help you gain the following knowledge: 

Why business models based on AI-powered platforms dominate the markets
How you can use these technologies to grow revenue and profitability
What are the 5 steps that can PIVOT your business and investment activities
Who will you need on the team to ensure your short and long term success
The course will include real world course studies, 40+ videos, research on the economics of today’s AI-powered platforms, and a final module to help you build your own AI business and investment activities.

# Module 1: Machines and Artificial Intelligence
Welcome to the module on artificial intelligence and business and platforms.
This is an overall introduction to how AI is being used in business but we'll also discuss
how it's used to support the platform based business model.
So there are a variety of sections in this module one is definitional, what is AI?
And what you know, what do we mean by that term, what's included and what isn't.
Then I'll go into a series of discussions about natural language AI, robotic process
automation and rule based AI.
Those two areas are highly related the core
of AI in business and particularly in platforms is machine learning.
So we'll spend some time on that
in a section and then a give you an overview of how AI is really being used in business.
My latest research and and book The AI Advantage is about enterprise AI.
So I'll really have that focus most people are interested in how AI affects them, particularly
jobs and skill related issues.
So I'll have a section on that and then I'll conclude with this issue of how does AI really
support or make possible modern platform based business models.

# Module 1 目标
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Identify and utilize different data sources (fundamental and alternative)
Identify best practices for developing and managing a company’s data
Identify material issues and understand their importance in developing data
Identify the different views of stakeholder, investor, and regulator definitions of data
Identify the leading organizations data use and governance issues
Assess the quality of a company’s process for becoming a data driven organization
Understand and follow the best practices in developing data driven strategies
Identify and prioritize the key stakeholders in building a data driven business
Understand the different requirements and regulations that are emerging

# 1.1.1.Video: What is Artificial Intelligence?
So, what the heck is artificial intelligence?
Anyway, there's a lot of confusion about that in the world at large.
And I think vendors have kind of added to the confusion by saying that whatever they
do is, of course, AI... since it's a hot term.
There is no widely accepted definition, but I think they're most common ones involve defining
AI as a collection of technologies, not just one that can do tasks that were previously
only possible by human brains.
So things like reasoning and perception and decision making, and other tasks requiring
kind of knowledge and judgment and so on.
However, that definition isn't perfect, because some of the things we do with AI, particularly
massive machine learning models that digest you know, unbelievable amounts of data could
have never been performed by human brains.
And, of course, there is some debate about whether some technologies are smart enough
or new enough to be included in AI robotic process automation.
Some people say, well, it's not really smart enough to be true AI.
Statistical machine learning has been around for a long time, 30 or 40 years, pretty well
established in business already.
So how can it be AI, if it's, if it's that old, I just think within a particular organization,
you should have a list of what's included and what isn't, be consistent about it.
I tend to be pretty inclusive about the whole thing, because all of these technologies are
getting smarter, some have been around for a while, some are relatively newer.
I don't think it it really matters all that much to address those particular factors.
So what are the technologies that we tend to include?
So machine learning, as I say, statistics based technology that's kind of at the core
of AI, it's been around for a while, neural networks are a form of machine learning that
are typically used for classification oriented problems they've been around for a while,
as well, 20 years or so.
We have a newer form of neural networks called Deep Learning that is really just a more complex
and multi layered form of neural network.
And that's relatively newer, it's only been widely used over the last decade or so.
And people are very excited about it as the kind of newest and potentially most powerful
form of AI, natural language processing technologies have been around for a long time, both the
understanding side and then the generation side producing, you know, kind of automated
text and stories and so on.
Rule engines were sort of considered the last generation of AI.
They are based on sets of rules, logic based rules, if then statements, in many cases,
they were at the core of expert systems that companies and the media were very excited
about in the late 80s and early 90s, it turns out, companies are still using them.
So they're, so they're certainly not dead.
As I said, robotic process automation, not the smartest of these technologies, probably
the dumbest and many ways, but getting smarter all the time.
And like a lot of these other technologies, it is increasingly being combined with other
AI capabilities.
And some sort of, you know, cognitive cloud, people refer to cognitive technologies as
just a synonym for AI.
Increasingly, we're seeing combinations of these things and in various ways.
So just how smarter these smart machines?
I mean, this chart, which I developed a few years ago, suggests that we been at this for
a while, and you have different tasks types along the side margins, we analyze numbers,
we digest words and images, we need to perform digital tasks with AI, and we need to perform
physical tasks.
So, we started with a whole generation of, of technologies that really support humans
in performing these tasks.
So in terms of analyzing numbers, we've been at that for a long time, with business intelligence
and data visualization and, and analytics of various types, the same in words and images.
We had character in speech recognition that was really not autonomous at all, it was oriented
to helping humans make sense of things.
In the digital space, we had business process management tools.
And in the physical task area, we had, sort of, robots that were operated remotely.
So then we get into another generation of repetitive task automation and analytics.
This might be operational analytics or scoring models, which actually started to use machine
learning in words and images, we have larger scale image recognition and machine vision
often used in in manufacturing processes, even though it wasn't terribly accurate.
Rule engines helped us with repetitive digital tasks.
Robotic Process Automation is really in that space as well, which uses rules and some other
technologies.
And then in robotics, that the modern industrial robot can perform repetitive tasks not particularly
good at, you know, responding to its environment.
So then we get into another generation of technologies and problem in context, awareness
and learning.
And that's typically knowing about context means you just consider multiple factors,
you know, my smartphone might tell me: Tom, you know, you need to get to the airport now,
because I know your your schedule, I have your calendar, and I know where you are, and
I know how long it takes to the airport, and I know what your flight is.
So you need to get from where you are now to the airport.
That's, in a way, knowledge of context.
So automated machine learning starts to move into into that space.
Neural Networks are more along those lines in digesting words and images, we have Q&A
oriented systems like Watson.
And then in general, natural language processing, intelligent agents, we don't really have context
awareness yet in the repetitive digital tax space yet, but we're going to and as I said,
with combinations of other forms of AI and robotic Process Automation will have that.
And then as we get fully autonomous robots and fully autonomous vehicles, and so on,
that's really performing physical tasks using context awareness and, and learning.
You notice in the next category, self aware intelligence, we're not there yet at all.
We have movies that have smart machines and robots that are self aware and intelligent,
but not in real life yet.
And then as we get further along, we see all these technologies start together, I call
it the great convergence.
So in the end, I think these individual categories sort of break down and the machines can basically
do it all.
This might be useful if you're trying to figure out what what's really at the core of a I
really only three things: statistics, which are at the core of machine learning, semantics,
which have been at the core of some forms of natural language processing.
Although recently statistically based natural language processing has come to be a bit more
powerful and more successful, you still have some some devotees of semantics based NLP
and then logic and the form of rules, as I said.
All of those go into a series of AI methods, including things like neural networks, and
deep learning, machine learning - all of those are mostly statistics based rule engine since
I'd say mostly logic based and natural language processing can be either statistics or semantics
based or both.
IBM Watson is an example of, of a technology that uses both statistics typically in the
form of logistic regression and semantics as well to make sense of language and questions
and so on.
And then you have a whole variety of applications of AI, how do we recognize images?
How do we recognize speech?
How do we create intelligent agents and chatbots or intelligent robots or co bots, collaborative
robots?
We need to do things like predictive and classification which is the typical task of machine learning
and robotic process automation.
As I said, combination of rules and technologies that allow interfaces to multiple systems.
So it may be helpful to kind of classify is that an underlying tool, specific AI method
or an application of AI?
In terms of the technologies that people are actually using.
This is from a survey that I did with Deloitte in 2017, Robotic Process Automation because
it's the easiest AI technology tends to be the most common, followed very closely behind
by statistical machine learning as I say technology that's been around for a while.
NLP more than half were using it, expert systems given up for dead but still alive and half
of the organizations are 49%.
Deep learning newer and kind of coming on strong, 34% and physical robots in about a
third mostly manufacturing oriented organizations.
So you start to see there really are a collection of technologies here and today, they're pretty
much separate, although I think in many cases they'll be combined in the future.

# 1.1.2.Reading: Artificial Intelligence for the Real World

In 2013, the MD Anderson Cancer Center launched a “moon shot” project: diagnose and recommend treatment plans for certain forms of cancer using IBM’s Watson cognitive system. But in 2017, the project was put on hold after costs topped $62 million—and the system had yet to be used on patients. At the same time, the cancer center’s IT group was experimenting with using cognitive technologies to do much less ambitious jobs, such as making hotel and restaurant recommendations for patients’ families, determining which patients needed help paying bills, and addressing staff IT problems. The results of these projects have been much more promising: The new systems have contributed to increased patient satisfaction, improved financial performance, and a decline in time spent on tedious data entry by the hospital’s care managers. Despite the setback on the moon shot, MD Anderson remains committed to using cognitive technology—that is, next-generation artificial intelligence—to enhance cancer treatment, and is currently developing a variety of new projects at its center of competency for cognitive computing.

cj: 交钱才能答。。。

# 1.2.1.Natural Language AI Applications
So natural language is one of the key applications of AI.
If you think about it, we've been trying for this for a long time.
And Alan Turing who invented the Turing test, argued that's one of the key task of computers
to be able to interact with other humans without humans really knowing is that a computer on
the other side are real human.
And nobody's really passed that test yet.
Although we're, I think we're getting close.
It's because human language is very difficult to master.
It has a lot of different complexities.
There are a lot of different human languages.
Of course, we've tried in the past with kind of rule based approaches, scripted approaches,
even semantic approach, it's a kind of classify language in terms of its parts of speech,
and so on, it's been really quite difficult.
But still there are lots of applications of this, you can see why organizations would
be interested, we'd like to interact with our customers.
And in many cases, we're not quite confident yet turning our customers over to our NLP
system will say, well, let's try it out on our employees, maybe to help them with their
IT problems or to check their vacation day balance or something like that.
A lot of companies are interested in having natural language be the front end interface
for various types of enterprise software, you know, from spreadsheets, all the way to
enterprise resource planning systems.
And increasingly, when we interact with complex devices, cars, for example, we can do so in
language.
Now, this ability has been present for a while, but it hasn't really been accurate enough
for us to really want to use it all that much.
Most people don't use the NLP based interfaces for their cars as the recognition of language
gets to the 95-99% level will be much more likely to to do that.
So chat bots are intelligent agents typically have a variety of components.
And this is just to show you how complex this can be.
First, we have to kind of recognize what's coming in from a human in terms of what are
they saying?
How do we make sense of it?
And then we have to sort of figure out really how what the human is asking for relates to
what we can offer.
So there's classification of intent.
There's a dialogue manager that keeps track of the language going back and forth, we have
business rules and logic that dictate what we can say and how it relates to each other.
Sentiment analysis to maybe know how the customer is feeling about the the interaction and then
a knowledge base that suggest, you know, what kinds of answers can we actually give.
And then once we figure all that out, we have to generate the knowledge and go back to the
customer or the employee and say, you know, here's our response to what you say, that
can be a pretty complex set of capabilities.
Now, just as, as one real life example, you have this chatbot at Bank of America called
Erica started in March 2018, and Rhode Island and has now been rolled out to all states.
Already to have more than a million users.
So it's been pretty successful, although it's pretty limited.
It does work with a variety of different interfaces that can be voice-based or text-based.
Or you can just use cap and gesture interfaces on your on your smartphone app, mostly to
address structure transactions, what's my account balance or did my paycheck get deposited.
There is a search capability that's been quite popular show me all the things I bought from
Amazon this month, which you know, you can also get from Amazon, but that has been popular
with Erica and it integrates some financial literacy content.
And eventually Bank of America says there will be personalized recommendations probably
saying, you know, you need to save more if you ever want to retire, for example.
A kind of higher-end tool comes from this vendor IPsoft, it's called Amelia and they
have a you know, a human who is sort of the Avatar for Amelia IPsoft was in the IT automation
business before that tool called IP center.
And they kind of broaden out its capability so it could deal with a whole variety of problems.
It does compete with Watson in the intelligent agent marketplace, there is some customization
involved, unless some other customer has already done, I don't know, property and casualty
insurance conversations or something like that.
Then maybe you can take advantage of their early adoption.
But even then, you'll probably have to put in your company specific business rules and
policies into the system.
It usually takes at least a few months, it can learn a little bit it can kind of observe
how humans solve a particular problem that it couldn't solve.
And after there are several of those it can start to propose an answer itself.
It has a pretty advanced attributes like the person conversing with it can change the subject
during conversation and it'll pick that up and it has some degree of emotional intelligence
like noting, you know, this customer is really mad and maybe I should turn them over to a
human supervisor.
Like most chatbots I found that Amelia, even though it's pretty sophisticated tool has
often been used first internally or for things like HR or IT Help Desk or to help agents
solve problems and then they pass the answer on to customers.
Just because we're not quite ready to turn customers completely over to this capability.
There is a bank in Sweden SE Bank that has adopted Amelia with a name change that called
it Aida for some reason I was assuming that was a Swedish name but apparently it isn't,
but first they had to translate Amelia's capabilities into Swedish, which took quite a while.
And first they said we're going to try this out and employees on an IT help desk and Amelia
did pretty well provided 24-7 support now she's considered a trainee on the customer
service desk and I think SEBank has done a good job of saying this is just kind of a
beta capability try it out we're not replacing anything else, but if you want you can talk
to a human agent but if you're calling you know 2am maybe Amelia might be the only thing
available.
Give it a shot, give her a shot.
Customer service agents apparently like her because she takes some of the most boring
and repetitive kind of customer questions and nobody's lost their jobs yet.
And in fact that SEBank people say that's not their intention at all.

# 1.2.2.Knowledge Check: Natural Language AI Applications

# 1.3.1.Video: Robotic Process Automation and Rule-Based Systems
Now this section is on robotic process automation and rule based systems, which are related.
RPA, as many people refer to it as kind of, as I said the dumbest of AI technologies,
but getting smarter all the time, particularly companies and vendors are saying, you know,
we can link it to machine learning, or we can link it to natural language processing.
It's not really a physical robot.
And I don't, I don't really like the name robotic process automation, but it seems to
have stuck, it's really just a piece of software.
And what it does is it will perform structured digital tasks, typically back office tasks
and mimic a human in in doing so the task, of course, have to be pretty consistent and
structured and repeatable.
As I said, it's not that smart, there is a process flow that's been specified in advance
driven by rules that a company can specify, and also a kind of a graphic flow diagrams,
it's like, first, you know, you do this, and then you do this, and so on.
And this technology is often called a swivel chair technology, because it's as if a human
user were sitting at a swivel chair and kind of swiveling back and forth going from one
system to another.
The system can interface with multiple different systems through the quote, "presentation layer,"
basically, as as a human user would.
And in many cases, they are used from moving information from one system to another, maybe
extracting information from a customer email and putting it into some sort of transaction
system, for example.
But these these technologies are very popular, they have a number of strengths.
One, they're really easy to implement.
In many cases, they don't even need much consulting help, they typically have relatively high
fast ROI compared to most AI technologies.
They allow sort of what's called an often in financial services straight through processing
with little or no human intervention.
And as I suggested, AI and RPA together can be pretty smart and can learn a bit and can
start to make more complex decisions in the process based on data and analysis.
And most of the things that RPA does, arguably human shouldn't have been doing anyway, it's
mostly boring, repetitive work.
And for the most part, human workers are pretty happy giving that up.
Now, there are some shortcomings RPA doesn't learn on its own, and can only act on preset
rules.
Let's say you maybe can combine it with other technologies that might allow us to some learning
the rules might need to be revised as your business change.
And if you change the underlying systems with which RPA interfaces, you're going to have
to change how RPA uses that system.
That's not a big deal if you have one or two little RPA robots.
But if you have 1000, that could be a big task, the AI capabilities so far, that can
be combined with RPA are pretty narrow AI in general performs, narrow tasks.
So that's not surprising.
And even with some AI capabilities, RPA, may not be smart enough for some applications.
So you, you don't necessarily want to use it as your only AI platform.
They're only only certain things that it can do.
Now, as I said, rule based systems are a component of RPA and these were very popular and kind
of the last generation the last AI spring when everybody was very excited about expert
systems in the 80s and 90s.
And as you might suspect, the rules use if then statements to make a series of decisions.
It works pretty well up to a point if there aren't too many rules.
Typically, once you get over 100, or 200 rules, the rules start to interact in funny ways,
and changing the rules can be difficult and time consuming.
But there's still used and applications like insurance, underwriting, credit approval and
banking.
And most of the organizations I talked to say, you know, they do a good job of pricing
insurance.
We don't really need any more sophisticated technology, even though you know, they have
been around for a while.
This is a picture of a old AI based system that ran on Lyft and was optimized for rules.
You don't see that much around anymore, but the technology hasn't gone away.
And rules do provide a bit of kind of explanation and transparency that a lot of organizations
found appealing.

# 1.3.2.Knowledge Check: Robotic Process Automation and Rule-Based Systems

# 1.4.1.Video: Machine Learning: The Core of Platform AI
Now, machine learning is really the core of AI, and specifically the core platform oriented
business model.
So I'll say a little bit more about it, then maybe some of the other technologies.
And it's also a very broad and kind of sweeping category in the world of AI.
In general, machine learning refers to analytical approach, it's kind of analytics on steroids,
if you will, that can improve not typically continuously, but episodically with human
intervention, each time they can improve at their task, or the decision they're trying
to make using new data.
The task that is trying to performance typically, prediction, sometimes classification as well,
machine learning can deal with structured data.
Typically, when we say structured data, we mean rows and columns of numbers, and unstructured
data, like images, and voice recordings, and so on.
There are a variety of different types of machine learning, you hear about supervised,
and unsupervised and reinforcement, and so on.
By far the most common in business is supervised learning, which learns from some training
data.
And then you can also classify machine learning in terms of the types of algorithms used,
and there are a lot of, and more than 100 different possibilities - from things that
are very simple, like regression, to much more complex analytics, involving support
vector machines, and neural networks, and so on.
I won't go into detail on those.
But sometimes they even get combined, it's important to keep in mind, it's always statistical
in nature, these are statistical models that are being generated and applied.
Now edits very simplest, this is a common thing to do.
And so I have here a picture of the of the factors that are used in a credit score, which
many of you may be familiar with, it's used in most countries around the world to determine,
you know, are we worthy of a bank or credit card company giving us some credit.
And so the simplest form of machine learning would be to say - Okay, I'm running going
to run a linear regression equation on part of my data, we'll call that the training data
set where I know that customer group actually paid me back.
You know, have they been good credit risk - and then you use the resulting model, typically,
you would also validate that on another data set.
But once you have a model that you're happy with, and it's validated, you would then score
as it's often called or predict other cases where you don't know the outcome variable,
you don't know whether the person will pay you back or not.
And credit score models have been around for about 30 years or so in the United States.
There are a lot of people who talk about predictive analytics.
Predictive analytics and machine learning are basically the same thing.
And so it's using data that, for which, we already know the outcome to predict other
data environments where we don't know the outcome we're seeking to predict or classify.
So it can be very simple.
On the other hand, it can be very complex, deep learning is one form of neural network
and neural networks are one approach to machine learning.
So we kind of have multiple layers of this technology.
Deep doesn't mean profound or really smart, it just means there are multiple levels of
features.
Our variables, features are what we call variables in machine learning, I'm not not sure why
exactly somehow that that term change along the way... the goal of deep learning is still
to predict or somewhat more commonly than in traditional machine learning to classify,
you know, is this a picture of a cat on the on the internet or not?
One of humankind's greatest achievements was to figure out a picture of a cat is that a
cat or not.
And this particular technology is quite well suited to things like image recognition, and
speech recognition, it typically requires a lot, in many cases, thousands or millions
of labeled data, this is actually a cat, and it can only learn about it in that way.
These are very popular today, people are very excited about this technology, but it can't
do everything.
And it can be easily manipulated and confused if you will, and because these models are
so complex, and so kind of black box oriented, virtually impossible to interpret them, even
by a really smart data scientist, or regulate them, so you're not going to see them all
that often in highly regulated environments, like financial services or healthcare.
So this may look like a somewhat complex model, but it's actually a simple deep learning model
with only three layers between the inputs and the outputs.
So it does kind of look like a model of how the brain might process information with individual
neurons and links between them.
So that's where the neural network analogy came, most people say, it's not really much
more than a metaphor, the brain is much more complex.
And in many cases, we don't even understand how the brain perceives and makes decisions.
But this is a simple picture of a deep learning model.
You start to see how it might be very complex to interpret.
And the features or variables, these nodes in the layers, in many cases are quite abstract,
they, you know, they don't correspond to anything in real life.
So if you're looking at a picture of a cat, one of those variables or features doesn't
necessarily say, you know, fuzzy face or two eyes or, or two points for ears, it's much
more complex and abstract than that.
Neural networks and deep learning are getting better all the time.
And they're in many circumstances, they're better than a human at many simple image recognition
tasks.
And there's an image database called image net and it kind of annual competition to see
how well can these models do at identifying in images.
And they've gotten better than humans, in many cases already on simple visual images.
But if it's a complex visual image, where a lot of things are going on, typically not
as good can be easily tricked by small changes in the image - it's not uncommon.
I showed you a model with three intermediate layers, it's not uncommon to see 150 different
layers and thousands of features.
And some models even have thousands of layers and multiple thousands of features.
We found that these models run really well on a technology that was originally invented
for another purpose, kind of drawing images and things like video games, we call them
graphics processing units.
And it turns out, they do a very good job of running deep learning models quite quickly
and, and accurately.
So companies like Nvidia who make those kinds of processors have really prospered because
of deep learning.
So there are lots of different ways that we can use this technology.
Platforms increasingly are using deep learning, particularly for speech and image recognition.
We see it a lot in financial services, but only in non-regulated components.
So if a bank wants to look at whether you have an image of a, I don't know, a piggy
bank, on your Instagram site, they could probably get away with using it.
But if they want to deny you credit on the basis of a deep learning model, probably the
regulators are not going to go along with that all of the image recognition in autonomous
vehicles is done with this technology, we're starting to see them for radiology, image
recognition, and healthcare, although it's early days for that.
Image oriented advertising uses them a lot.
And then in addition to various industries, we also see it in a whole variety of functions.
Marketing makes particular use of image recognition, some in finance, and information technology
to identify really kind of complex problems, supply chain, etc, etc.
So this is a powerful technology that is increasingly popular in the world of AI.
Now, there are a number of strengths, it can, as I suggested, it can be more accurate and
faster than humans, the models can be highly granular, and detailed in machine learning.
You can have tens of thousands of models that predict some aspect of customer behavior - will
they buy a particular product, or even will an individual executive within a company be
likely to buy a particular product?
It takes a lot of effort to develop thousands of models.
But we have something called automated machine learning now that can generate multiple models
and do most of the things that data scientists used to use.
Some people call it Auto ML.
And, as I suggested, it can handle both structured and unstructured data.
But these models tend to be complex and difficult to understand the learning is not continuous,
as I say, it's episodic, if you develop a model, you deploy it to to do scoring, if
you want to improve that model, you typically have to go through another round of model
development with some new data.
In any case, it's going to require a lot of training data training data sets can be difficult
to recreate, they have to have that labeled outcome and a lot of cases that requires a
lot of effort to go through and label you know, is that a cat or not, these systems
don't have any common sense.
They don't have any ability to innovate, some people are starting to criticize them for
really not using the broader context that you know, the human brain might be able to
apply and because they're so complex and may require a data scientist but now that we have
tools like automated machine learning, probably less requirements for people who understand
the the ins and outs of, you know, what model is suited to what kind of data.

cj：在人工智能领域，机器学习也是一个非常广泛且全面的类别。
一般来说，机器学习指的是分析方法，它是一种强化版的分析方法，
如果你愿意这么说的话，它通常不是持续改进的，而是在人工干预下阶段性地改进的，每次它们都能改进其任务，或者改进它们试图利用新数据做出的决策。
机器学习通常试图执行预测，有时也试图执行分类，它可以处理结构化数据。
通常，我们所说的结构化数据是指行和列的数字，以及非结构化数据，例如图像、语音记录等等。
机器学习有很多不同的类型，你听说过监督学习、
非监督学习、强化学习等等。
目前，商业领域最常见的是监督学习，它从一些训练数据中学习。
然后，你还可以根据所使用的算法类型对机器学习进行分类，
机器学习有很多种，甚至超过100种不同的可能性——从非常简单的算法（例如回归分析）到更复杂的分析（例如支持向量机、神经网络等等）。
我不会详细介绍这些算法。
但有时它们甚至会结合在一起，重要的是要记住，它本质上始终是统计的，

# 1.4.2.Reading: What We Talk About When We Talk About AI

# 1.4.3.Knowledge Check: Machine Learning

# 1.5.1.Video: How Is AI being used in business?
So just a little overview of how AI is being used in business that I've encountered in
my research over the last year or two.
In general, pretty big impact on the economy already and getting bigger.
This is all somewhat speculative, of course, but McKinsey Global Institutes speculated
that it could deliver 13 trillion of additional economic activity and raise the GDP growth
per year by 1.2% around the world.
Accenture had a study suggesting that AI could double annual economic growth rates by 2035
and increase labor productivity by up to 40%, which would be quite astounding given that
we're not having any productivity increases at all.
Now, there are lots and lots of startups in the US, more than 2000 by most accounts.
Global spending on AI in 2017 was more than $15 billion, and, you know, we're still in
the early stages here.
There's not much doubt that there could be dramatic changes in multiple industries, almost
anyone you can name and the World Economic Forum, this group of business leaders and
governmental leaders from around the world, have kind of classified AI as the fourth industrial
revolution, something that will really impact almost every economic activity.
So getting much more concrete about what's actually happening today.
Last year (2017), I studied 152 cognitive technology projects mostly Deloitte-based,
but some other ones as well.
And they fell into really three major categories of activity almost half were in this category,
that for this purpose, I'll call robotics and cognitive automation.
It's really mostly robotic process automation.
But in some cases augmented with with some cognitive or AI capabilities.
And that's for routine data intensive administrative tasks.
Typically in the in the back office of firms.
Cognitive insights mostly uses machine learning to derive granular statistical insights from
structured data, although it can be used for for unstructured data as well.
And then Cognitive Engagement, a little less common, but 16% typically uses language in
a few cases, image based interaction with customers or employees.
And the fact that this is relatively a small percentage reflects, I think, the difficulties
of dealing with human language even with some of the new AI tools that we have today.
So just examples of these project types of robotics and cognitive automation might be
taking data out of an email system or out of call center speech that's been converted
to text and putting it into another system; a transactional system perhaps or replacing
a lost credit card or an ATM card without a human needing to be involved.
Or natural language generation really sort of falls into this category as well, it's
somewhat robotic.
So there's a company USAA that is producing automated investment reports.
If you don't like charts and graphs, it will give you a text based summary of how your
401K's are performing over the last quarter or so.
Cognitive insights, as I said, granular insights typically on unstructured data.
So big companies like Cisco Systems and IBM have tens of thousands of propensity models
suggesting what individual customers might buy and that uses machine learning.
A lot of banks and insurers are identifying credit and claimed fraud with machine learning
these days, one less common, but quite useful thing is to look across different databases
within the same company and identify matches that will allow you to integrate data elements
and fields.
So GE, for example, did use that technology to look at integrating all of its 75 different
supplier databases.
And it wanted to know where do we have suppliers who are selling to multiple business units
so we can ask for for bigger discounts from them.
And this is historically been a very labor intensive task for humans to do.
It hasn't worked terribly well, it takes years in some cases...
This took only a couple of months to combine that and now GE is doing customer data and
product and component data as well.
Cognitive engagement where we're Interacting with customers and / or employees.
We like to, in many cases, do customer service that way, but a bit more common now to see
it used for employees, they sort of help us work out the kinks.
And then at some point, we'll move it to customers.
And then this survey, I worked with Deloitte on about, what do cognitive aware managers,
managers who understand cognitive technologies in AI and what their organizations are doing
with it - where are they really focusing their efforts and so one of the things we asked
them was, what did you want to achieve with this technology?
And I was somewhat pleased to see that the the largest category: naming it in the top
three responses, were enhancing existing products and services with AI.
So not an internal use something that would really benefit customers.
There were a lot of people who said, we want to make better decisions with this technology,
or we want to optimize internal business operations, but create new products was also high - it
was third ranked in terms of number one choice anyway.
Somewhat interestingly, the lowest choice was reduce headcount through automation.
So many of the predictions that we've seen about what AI would do for jobs and skills
may not be borne out if that is such a low objective of these cognitive aware managers.
Now, some quick examples of what some mainstream organizations are doing with AI: Vanguard
is using it for Robo-advice.
Not really complex AI, there are some other companies that are using more complex AI,
but Vanguard has been the most successful in this Robo-advice space.
I think in part, because from the beginning, they allowed customers to get inputs from
a machine about what they should do in their investing but also from a human.
So they combine automated and human investment advice from the very beginning of this program,
which they call personal Advisor Services.
And it does test like portfolio rebalancing, tax loss harvesting, it will tell you will
you outlive your money if you live to age 95 or whatever.
They charge half of what they used to charge for human advice and they require lower levels
of wealth than most human investment advice sources.
They are up to 100 billion or more under on assets under management and growing very rapidly
and they say what's left for the humans in this process for our financial advisors...
it is working with customers to help them make smart financial decisions.
When one of my students called financial psychiatry, which I think is a is a good term for it.
NASA is using RPA (robotic process automation) for a variety of shared services tasks in
their National Shared Services Center, mostly financially oriented processes, which is common
for RPA they think it will grow a lot from those initial four.
They're not trying to layoff people, they just can't really do all the work they need
to do with people that they have.
They're trying to add more cognitive capabilities.
My favorite quote from NASA is this is not rocket science folks, and we should know you
know, we do rocket science.
They are doing more rocket science oriented AI and things like celestial navigation and
they're working with partners like Google and Intel and so on to to do that cutting
edge work but RPA is something that that they can do on their own.
Pfizer is one of the most aggressive adopters of AI.
They're using it for a whole variety of purposes, identifying which physicians are most likely
to prescribe their drugs effectively to identify which patients are most likely to take all
of their hepatitis vaccines.
They do have an IBM Watson project, which they told me they are cooling on - a lot of
pharma firm signed deals with Watson early on to try to identify drugs faster.
Although it turned out to be a tough problem.
They're using deep learning to mine electronic health records and lab data for certain types
of auto immune diseases.
They told me that they have 100 different AI projects underway, kind of all overseen
by a center of excellence at the corporate level.
So that gives you an idea of how advanced this is in some of the most sophisticated
companies.
Now, the question arises should you go for a highly aggressive moonshot or kind of pick
the low hanging fruit.
MD Anderson Cancer Center based in Houston started a very ambitious project that they
really called a moonshot.
It was to use Watson to treat certain forms of cancer.
After five years or so, a lot of push from their CEO $62 million spent on Watson and
consulting, a lot of media visibility, they basically declared failure they were not able
to make sufficient progress...
Never treated a patient, didn't integrate it with their electronic record system, and
the project was put on indefinite hold.
That's been the case for a year and a half or so now.
But at the same organization, they were using a variety of lower hanging fruit use cases
for things like identifying which patients need more assistance, more advice about where
to say or which patients really need help and paying their bills, so we can start working
with them early on, or even helping staff with IT problem.
It's a very prosaic issue, but one that's very popular with AI.
And these these projects worked and they created real value.
So in many cases, I think organizations will find those moonshots are not likely to hit
the moon, but less aggressive projects are likely to pay off.
So there's another example - another Watson based one that didn't really work out at DBS
Bank, one of the biggest banks in Asia based in Singapore, they tried to create a robo
advisor with Watson.
It turns out Watson couldn't really do the job.
It couldn't read charts and graphs, it couldn't recognize, you know, the key language in different
investment researchers reports and so they found it wasn't even as good as some of their
human advisors but the same organization said we're not going to give up on AI, we're going
to do things like a chat bot for a digital bank.
They had an India where they're trying to keep costs low.
Even predicting is a cash machine going to run out of cash.
They were able to improve that 55 fold.
They reduced attrition of sales people by predicting who is most likely to leave.
And of course, they were focused on trading fraud related issues.
So they're very committed to AI just not as committed to the idea of a moonshot.
And more and more organizations I talked to feel exactly the same way.
So what are the challenges that organizations have with enterprise AI.
In this Deloitte survey of cognitive aware managers integrating AI with existing processes
and systems was the most challenging issue.
Some people found the technology too expensive, many found that managers don't really understand
the different types of AI and what they do, which now you will understand.
They can't get enough people with expertise.
The technologies themselves are somewhat immature, some people thought oversold in the marketplace,
AI.
But in another question we ask, do you think AI is overhyped?
A number of people said yes, something is 15% or so.
But almost twice as many said, No, it's underhyped.
So a lot of bullish attitudes about this from from leading companies these days.
Now, how do you take all these technologies and become a cognitive company or an AI driven
company?
I think you have to start with pilots, but you want to make sure those pilots get into
production, many of them anyway, but use different technologies and try them out, take small
steps toward a bold objective, maybe many low hanging fruit projects in a particular
domain like customer service, and eventually it will seem transformational.
I think, think about humans as being involved all along augmenting the capabilities of AI,
AI augmenting the capabilities of the humans.
We're going to have to figure out how humans and machines work together effectively.
This has got to take a while for employees to make the transition.
So give them some time and ability to prepare.
And I think in many cases, you're going to want somebody in charge of this important
capability, running a center of excellence or an AI center within your organization.

# 1.5.2.Reading - Forbes - Predicting the future of AI from bellwether companies

# 1.5.3.Knowledge Check

# 1.6.1.Video: The impact of AI on jobs and skills
So a lot of people are interested, of course, what does this mean for my job?
What does it mean for the kinds of skills that I might have to have in the future.
And this has been a topic that's been of interest to me for several years.
I coauthored a book with Julia Kirby and 2016 called "Only Humans Need Apply".
But that was quite focused on on that particular topic.
So there is reason for concern.
And, you know, we can look through the history of automation and see manual labor jobs, often
automated, and 18th and 19th centuries and farms and factories.
And in the 20th century, we started to, to automate administrative and service jobs,
not too many people, you know, get cash from a bank teller anymore, or get an airplane
ticket by, you know, going up to the, to the counter and talking to a person.
And the scary thing is, you know, we always thought we could go upstream and to knowledge
work jobs, but now those are being automated as well.
AI is coming right at those and many cases in the 21st century.
So there I think there certainly is cause for concern.
But, you know, I would argue that the answer to will these jobs be automated, is kind of,
yes and no.
On the one hand, lots of tasks will be automated AI tends to go after individual tasks, not
entire jobs, most of us do multiple tasks within our job.
Probably will see some knowledge workers losing their jobs.
As tasks get automated, it may depress hiring for a number of years, but I think it will
be relatively marginal, you know, maybe we'll have nine lawyers where, where there were
10 within a law firm or, or a legal department.
Some might argue, you know, a few less lawyers might not be so horrible!
There will be a lot of jobs where people will work alongside smart machines, nobody knows
exactly how many, although there are a lot of predictions.
We could with the productivity gains from AI fund retraining, and redeployment programs
or pay guaranteed minimum incomes.
I don't necessarily believe that will happen in the US anytime soon.
But it is possible.
But workers cannot be complacent about this.
And, you know, we tend to think it'll happen to somebody else.
So in one recent Gallup survey, 73% said, "Yeah, AI will eliminate more jobs, and it
creates", but less than a third of those were really worried about how it would affect them
personally.
They thought this is going to happen to other people.
And that I think, is not a safe perspective to take on this issue.
So I do believe that in general we'll see more augmentation than large scale automation.
We'll see smart machines and smart humans.
Hopefully, there'll be smart working alongside each other.
The surveys that I've seen suggest that while automation may be appealing to many managers,
one survey that I recently worked on with Deloitte found that 63% said they would like
to automate as many jobs as possible, but they didn't think it was going to happen anytime
soon.
And it was not high on their list of objectives.
Most of the projects that I've seen so far involving cognitive technologies or AI, involve
augmentation.
And we've seen very little job loss thus far.
That could change, but, you know, so far, so good.
So, in this Deloitte survey of cognitive aware managers, we asked, you know, what do you
think's going to happen to jobs within your organization, three years from now, five years
from now, and then longer term, 10 years from now.
And the white category and these bars is the augmentation category.
A lot of that in three years, somewhat less than five, less again, 10.
The black bar is the massive job loss category, substantial job loss category, pretty low
in three years, a little bit bigger than five and pretty substantial in 10 years.
But the good news is that the bar that grows a lot over that time frame is new jobs from
AI, pretty small and three years, but bigger in five years, and as big as anything in 10
years.
So we all know that new jobs are going to be created, some jobs will be eliminated.
We don't know exactly what the net impact will be.
And I think the key is to make sure that you are either able to work in an augmented capacity
with these machines or be ready to adopt a new job and learn the necessary skills to
perform well in the context of an economy based on smart machines.

# 1.6.2.Discussion: The Impact of AI on Jobs and Skills

# 1.7.1.Video: How Does AI Support Platforms?人工智能如何真正支持或实现基于现代平台的商业模式。
So this question of, "how does AI support these platform-based business models?"
It's really essential for modern platform based businesses to succeed.
I'll say a little bit about why in this in this section.
So we have massive amounts of data typically in these platforms.
They're almost always online businesses in some way or another data coming from, you
know, either one side or the other, from the business or consumer, etc..
So we typically are going to need machine learning to analyze that data, figure out
what's going on in our business, pair customers with products and services that they might
want, (a very simple level).
You know, what type of housing are you going to want to be shown on the Airbnb application,
or what's the best driver to pick you up and Uber?
All of that is determined by machine learning.
We can customize, we can personalize our customer offerings, we don't have to show every customer
the same thing.
We can know something from their past behaviors and use that to tailor what they see on our
site.
And if we have millions of customers, you know, you're not going to be able to call
a typical platform company and find a helpful customer service agent to talk to you because
they have millions of customers and not a lot of assets, they're going to try to turn
that over to things like intelligent agents and chatbots and so on.
So AI comes into play there.
We can predict resource requirements, you know, how many particular dwellings is Airbnb
going to need when they enter a new marketplace?
Or how many drivers does it make sense to try to recruit in in Uber or Lyft?
That's all done with AI models as well.
And just to kind of illustrate this - all of the most valuable platform companies from
Apple, alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. all have machine learning at the core
of at least the platform components of their businesses.
This is impossible to do it without that capability.
So just some quick examples AI widely used at Google / alphabet, the corporate name that
under which Google falls.
Originally used at Google for page rank algorithms, which was kind of the core of their early
business, and then advertising algorithms to show what ads to show for what types of
searches.
They began to research AI in depth in their GoogleX research labs in 2011 and that's when
they started to pursue this deep learning technology.
They hired Jeffrey Hinton, a Canadian university based researcher who had solved some critical
problems in deep learning.
So he became a Google employee, they needed some more capabilities, so they brought DeepMind,
they bought DeepMind, a London based company for deep learning expertise in 2014.
And they use a lot of that capability to beat some of the world's best Go players with AlphaGo
application.
By 2016 AI was so pervasive that over 2700 projects across alphabet were using machine
learning in a substantial way.
And, you know, it's not just the traditional Google-based business, but they have a self
driving car business unit called Waymo.
And, of course, deep learning is heavily used there, they have a medical diagnosis business
called Calico, and making sense of your genome and your podium, it's on pretty much impossible
without machine learning.
They even give away a prominent machine learning tool.
TensorFlow is a popular open source project used for machine learning.
And particularly for deep learning applications.
Facebook was another early adopter of these technologies, again, it has way too much data
to do otherwise.
But Facebook has been, I think, somewhat less successful with AI than Google, in part because
they really tried to do too much with it.
So their primary AI research focus has again, been on deep learning, with a strong focus
on facial recognition, image recognition.
It's used for captioning photos that you might post on Facebook, or identifying who some
of the people might be in those images.
It's also used for advertising, of course, which is key part of their business model.
Facebook has been very interested in identifying speech or images that are not appropriate
for being posted on the site.
And so they've tried to use AI quite aggressively for that purpose.
Although, as you may know, they have not been entirely successful.
A lot of stuff has gotten through, they've said that they're hiring 10,000 humans to
do this kind of analysis, just because AI can't quite do it yet.
It was also, AI was also used for a while to identify important news items that it would
kind of personalized and send out on the trending topics section of Facebook.
But turns out it could identify real news from fake news.
AI is also used for ad targeting.
But some ads, that snuck through were targeting racist, and Facebook got a lot of negative
publicity for that you may be quite aware of the fact that couldn't detect fake news
probably emanating from Russia, maybe some from some other places as well.
And as I suggested, I think this is primarily an issue of trying to do more with AI than
was really possible at the time.
Maybe at some point, it will be able to identify fake news and pornographic images accurately
and, and so on.
But it's been a problem for Facebook.
Amazon is quite aggressive with AI.
And they have tried some projects that might be called moonshots.
Amazon Go the convenience store now only one of them in their Seattle headquarters where
you can go in and and pick stuff off the shelf and feel like you're not paying for it until
you leave a store.
And of course, you get built on your smartphone for it.
They say they are working on automated drone deliveries that's not available yet.
Amazon Go had some problems and Drone deliveries are of course, not available yet.
So this is quite challenging, even for a highly capable organization like Amazon.
But Jeff Bezos wrote in their 2017 report to shareholders that they do a lot of machine
learning and the primary usage of it is what he called quietly but meaningfully improving
core operations.
Doing things like better demand forecasting or ranking products in search or product and
deal recommendations, merchandising decisions, detecting fraud, and of course, deep learning
getting increasingly good at machine translation.
So even at Amazon, one of the world's most sophisticated platform companies, there is
this focus on, you know, picking a low hanging fruit and over time making for a very successful
company.

一方面，许多任务将被自动化。人工智能倾向于处理单个任务，而不是
整个工作，我们大多数人的工作中都涉及多项任务。
我们可以利用人工智能带来的生产力提升，资助再培训和重新部署项目，或者支付最低保障收入。

我认为关键在于确保你要么能够在这些机器的增强能力下工作，要么准备好接受一份新工作，并学习必要的技能，以便在基于智能机器的经济环境中表现出色。

这些平台通常拥有海量数据。
它们几乎总是以某种方式在线运营，数据来自企业或消费者等不同方面。
因此，我们通常需要机器学习来分析这些数据，了解我们业务的现状，将客户与他们可能想要的产品和服务配对（非常简单的层面）。

# 1.7.2.Reading: AI-Driven Leadership

# 1.7.3.Knowledge Check: AI and Leadership

# 1.8.1.Video: What Are the Attributes of AI-Driven Leaders?人工智能驱动型领导解决方案的7个特质
So a key aspect of this issue of artificial intelligence is really, what's the role of
the leader?
And it's one that is often not given enough attention.
A lot of organizations say, Oh, we need to hire great talent, we need to get the best
data scientists, the best AI engineers.
But, I would argue that a critical prerequisite for this to work within organizations is having
leadership that really understands and provides a lot of support and commitment for artificial
intelligence.
So there is this idea of the AI-First organization and certainly there are a lot of tech firms
that are in that category.
A lot of the platform oriented firms the Google's, the Facebook's, the Airbnb's, and so on...
They say AI is so critical to our business that we need to deploy it in as many areas
of the business as we can, and as many business processes as we can possibly support with
it.
Now, most of these are tech firms now.
Google, for example, has 2700 or so projects underway involving AI, Pfizer, one of the
leading nontech firms has a little bit more than 100 or so.
So you see some sense of the relationship.
But those traditional businesses are moving in this direction as well.
And a number of leaders are starting to say, I need to really know more about this and
to provide more support for it.
The early adopters in this space are developing key strategies for AI.
They are appointing champions for AI throughout their business developing implementation roadmaps.
About a third, in a recent survey I did with Deloitte said, they are doing all of these
things, which I think suggests it's going to be difficult to be a fast follower in this
area.
So what are the attributes of AI driven leaders?
I wrote a little piece about this with Janet Foudy, who's the head of Deloitte Consulting
in the US and we came up with seven different factors.
Number one is you need to know something about these technologies.
I mean, AI is not one technology, but many, each technology does different types of things.
So it's pretty critical that executives have some sense of what are the capabilities of
the different technologies, the typical use cases, and so on.
So that may require some sort of formal or semi formal education oriented program.
Two, I mean, as with anything else, you want to don't want to use AI, for AI sake, you
have to have some clear business objectives to which you want to put this technology.
Some areas of the business where you think it can really make a difference and move the
needle.
What are the key business processes you're going to, to use it in?
Then, I think, AI is a little bit unusual in that it's important to set an appropriate
level of ambition for it within your company.
We can do highly aggressive moon shots, we can do low hanging fruit or variety of things
in-between.
I think the best way to go, it's probably a collection of relatively easy to accomplish
applications, maybe in a single area.
So you start to have an impact on the organization.
But knowing what your appropriate level of ambition is, even if you're really good at
technology, I think you should be careful about thinking you're going to transform your
business overnight with AI just doesn't typically work that way.
Um, many organizations have had problems getting to production deployments with AI, they do
a lot of pilots or prototypes or proofs of concept, but they don't really get to production
deployment.
And, you know, it's not without reason, that's where the behavioral change has to happen.
That's where workers have to figure out sort of what they're doing and what the machines
are doing.
That's where you're going to have to have interfaces with existing systems and processes.
So it's not easy.
But of course, you don't add any value with AI at all, unless you ultimately put it into
production.
This has been a problem with analytical systems within organizations, it's even more of a
challenge with AI.
Number five, you need to get people ready, I mean, there's going to be a need for a lot
of retraining, up-skilling, re-skilling.
In some of the surveys that I've worked on, there are actually a lot of employers who
say, it's going to be easier for me to hire people outside.
I don't want you to succumb to that temptation too much.
I think people within your organization can learn the necessary skills, but it's going
to take some time, you're going to have to give them some options, you're going to have
to say, here's what we need you to be able to do.
I think the organizations that start to do that early will be most successful.
Number six, is it's important to get the necessary data.
I mean, a lot of the organizations that I've worked with, and done research in, and talked
to about AI, they don't realize that data is, of course, the single most critical prerequisite.
In many cases, with machine learning, it's going to have to be labeled data In many cases,
labeling that data, you know, saying, what happened in the outcome variable or feature
is quite labor intensive.
So you need to start thinking at a pretty early stage, what data do we need to make
AI work for us?
What part of the business is it going to come from?
Is there external data that we can get to start to analyze.
This is a very critical asset.
And as with business analytics, I mean, the dirty secret of AI is that much of the work
is really about data and getting it ready and doing data management and not the sort
of sexy algorithmic component.
And then finally, you see change in organizations that do this well, in addition to all the
technical and data oriented stuff.
AI certainly requires a lot of effort and a capability in the IT organization, but it's
going to change jobs as well.
So there has to be a lot lot of input from HR, it's going to change the business process.
So various owners of the business are going to have to step up and say, yeah, I'm willing
to sponsor that kind of change.
It's important for us to do.
So this really has to be a collaborative effort and it works well in organizations that, overall,
are collaborative - where senior executives are talking to each other, where they're talking
to the rest of the organization frequently about the kinds of changes that they're going
to undergo.

cj: 
1.首先，你需要了解这些技术。
人工智能并非单一技术，而是多种技术，每种技术都有不同的功能。
2.必须有一些明确的业务目标，并将这项技术应用于这些目标。
你认为人工智能能够真正发挥作用并带来改变的某些业务领域。
你打算在哪些关键业务流程中使用它？
3.在公司内部为它设定一个合适的目标水平非常重要。
4.必须与现有系统和流程进行交互。
许多组织在将人工智能投入生产部署方面遇到了困难，他们做了很多试点、原型或概念验证，但并没有真正投入生产部署。
除非你最终将人工智能投入生产，否则它根本不会创造任何价值。
这一直是组织内部分析系统的问题，而对于人工智能来说，这更是一大挑战。
5.你需要让员工做好准备，我的意思是，需要大量的再培训、技能提升和再培训。
员工必须弄清楚自己在做什么，以及机器在做什么。
6.获取必要的数据至关重要。
我们需要哪些数据才能让人工智能为我们服务？
这些数据来自业务的哪个部分？
我们是否有外部数据可以进行分析？
这是一项非常关键的资产。
与商业分析一样，我的意思是，人工智能的秘密在于，大部分工作实际上都与数据有关，包括准备数据和进行数据管理，而不是那些性感的算法组件。
7.人工智能当然需要IT部门付出大量的努力和能力，但它也会改变工作岗位。
因此，人力资源部门必须投入大量精力，它将改变业务流程。
因此，企业的各级负责人必须站出来表示，‘是的，我愿意支持这种变革。’

SPEAKERS
Jeremy Achin, Interviewer, Tom Davenport
Interviewer 00:05
Can any and all companies do this? Can they all become AI driven?
Jeremy Achin 00:09
When we're working with companies, we systematically go through their business and find
every opportunity, whether it's an HR, sales or marketing, we haven't found examples where
there's no opportunity to apply AI to optimize something, automate something to impact
earnings in some way,
Tom Davenport 00:24
I agree with Jeremy, that there's no, no real limit on it,
Interviewer 00:27
it's going to have more of an impact on some companies and others, right?
Jeremy Achin 00:30
I think scale is an important factor in determining how much impact it can have. If you take a bank that's making, you know, trillions of payments, and you find some way to optimize
that just a little bit, when you apply it to a trillion dollars, it's a huge impact to the bottom
line of that company. So I think the amount of capital the company's playing with, the
number of employees they have, the amount of revenue, you can make a huge absolute
value impact to the company. But if you're a smaller company, you might not need, you
know, a half a billion dollars of impact your bottom line to raise an eyebrow, right?
Interviewer 01:05
You also if you're smaller, you might not have the data or enough of the data to be able to
move the needle with artificial intelligence. So is this really something that kind of larger
companies, or to be embracing more readily, more rapidly?
Tom Davenport 01:17
Big companies tend to have people whose job it is to look out for new technologies and how
they can be embedded in the organization. And I think that typically hastens the process by
which they they start using AI. They're probably more likely to have done analytics, the vast
majority of AI is analytical statistical in nature, you can't really just sort of leapfrog over that
you have to sort of have had some of those capabilities ahead of time.
Interviewer 01:46
What's the risk of not doing it? I mean, if you're not doing that, you basically toast?
Jeremy Achin 01:49
We thought about starting data robot, we're trying to solve the demand for data scientists
being so high compared to the supply of data scientists and that demand come from two
things: the amount of data increasing and increasing exponentially, and then the
competitive pressure to do something with the data. If one company you know, discovers
some way to get an edge out in the marketplace, the competitors have to do something to
compete. Otherwise, they see their you know, profit margins and their their top line just
dwindle away.
Tom Davenport 02:22
That was pretty much the way it was with analytics. You had Capital One say, we think
analytics can be the key to everything we do. And in the first 10 years, I return more value to
shareholders than any other company in the history of the United States. Capital One is now
quite aggressively pursuing AI. I think it's a sort of straightforward extension of being
aggressive on new technology, having a lot of data trying in the past to make sense of all
that data. And if you've done that, well, it's kind of a natural step to say we're going to use
AI now.

# 1.8.3.Discussion: AI Driven Leaders
Which of the seven attributes of AI-driven leaders is a strength of yours?  Which is a weakness and how can you shore it up?

# 1.9.1.Wrap Up: Machines and Artificial Intelligence
So to wrap up this module, we've looked at both the kind of definitional aspects of AI,
what are the the key components of AI, that key technologies that make up AI, natural
language, robotic process automation and rule based systems.
Machine learning, which I argued was really the core of both AI in business in general,
but specifically for platform based organizations.
I gave an overview of how AI is being used in business today, what are the keep types
of projects that organizations are undertaking?
What are some examples of what real companies are doing with AI?
We address the very important but still somewhat uncertain issue of how does AI really affect
us, both now and in the future?
The answer being not so much now, but in the future, I think nobody should be complacent
that AI won't take over key task that we perform, really trying to motivate you to think about
how you add value to smart machines.
And then the question of how does AI really support the platform based business model.
And I concluded that it's virtually impossible to do an online multi sided platform without
using AI, specifically machine learning, in most cases, to make sense of all of that data
to make personalized recommendations to determine what resources need to be aligned with what
customers you just don't find that and I gave a number of examples of companies that make
very effective use of AI and are some of the world's most highly valued companies in general,
and use platforms as key components of what they're what they're up to.
Finally, we talked about how AI is important for leaders and how leaders can advance seven
different approaches to AI within their organizations that really make their organizations AI first
companies using AI for very critical capabilities and their strategies, their business models,
their business processes, and even in their cultures and behaviors.

# Module 2: Video: Data for AI
Let's talk about data and data is the lifeblood of artificial intelligence.
We'll talk about five different pieces.
First will begin with why data is so key to artificial intelligence: how the data is used,
and in what ways.
Second, we'll talk about alternative data and why alternative data is really important.
Using data that's not the same as everyone else is what's allowing companies to create
differentiated data strategies.
Third, we'll talk about ways to find where even better to generate new alternative data
and how to manage the data within your organization.
Fourth, we'll talk about integrating data into your products and what that means for
products and for the life cycles of products.
And then finally, we'll wrap up with some components that any company needs to use in
order to be a data driven organization.

# Module 2 目标
By the end of the module, you will be able to:

Explain how data is used in an AI/ML application
Understand why alternative data is a key differentiator
Identify different data sources that a company can use (fundamental and alternative)
Understand the complexities of data management
Understand and follow the best practices in developing data driven strategies

SPEAKERS
Barry Libert, Vikram Mahidhar
Barry Libert 00:09
Hi. I'm Barry Libert. We're going to talk today about Genpact and with its head of AI Vikram
Mahidhar. Let me introduce you to my guest today. Vikram nice to see you, nice to see you,
again.
Vikram Mahidhar 00:19
Nice to see it as well, Barry
Barry Libert 00:21
Now, one things you and I run into regularly, is the difference between companies thinking
surveys and data are the same. Of course, I think many companies don't have the data that
you're talking about. So talk to me a little bit about your experience so far with companies
not understanding what data really is and what is data in your perspective for this?
Vikram Mahidhar 00:36
Okay, so so surveys are purely primary research and opinion related pieces.
Barry Libert 00:43
Yeah
Vikram Mahidhar 00:43
I wouldn't count that as as as real data
Barry Libert 00:47
Okay
Vikram Mahidhar 00:48
When it comes to analyzing and, you know, coming up with data driven insights and
decisions. In every company now, you know, with the adoption of cl oud data layer is being
separated from the application where it's a big movement out there, right? Everybody you
talk to, you know, a large aircraft manufacturer to a retailer, everybody's creating a data
lake or a data pond, or some form of the ocean, some some form of, you know, a water
bottle, right? But there's data in it. And, and what's happening out there is the intent of these
data lakes was "let's bring all pieces of all variables together, and then let's figure out and
insights to drive our business", right? However, when it comes to that insights layer, very, very
few companies have really figured out how do I mind this data, right? It's not about putting
data in SAP HANA and then accessing it. It's about actually looking at the business problem
framing the right business question then framing the solution correctly. Okay? And I'm
putting a lot of emphasis on this, because 95% of the projects that I come across failed
because they have not framed the problem correctly, right? And then thinking about, you
know, it's not about "Do I have all the data in one place or not?" It is about, "do I have the
right data?" I don't need big data, I'm okay with small data, but do I have the right data?
And if not, right, how a what algorithmic techniques am I going to use to actually analyze
that low density data or figure out where the holes are in the data and fill up those holes. Or,
second thing is, let me put some sort of a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) out there and then
collect more data, create more hooks for that data, right? So that's sort of you know, that's
the setup for data now another one very important piece that that most companies miss out
is the interaction data. And what that means is think about an autonomous car.
Barry Libert 03:03
Yep.
Vikram Mahidhar 03:05
Right? Living example. It was put out on the street more than 10 years ago. And when they
put it out, the amount of data that they had was a third of what they have today.
Barry Libert 03:19
Absolutely.
Vikram Mahidhar 03:19
After putting that on the street, they started gathering more data and they use that to
make, you know, the drivability of that car a lot more precise. And same thing applies to
even your applications. You don't have to wait until you have everything. Remember, you
were at zero...
Barry Libert 03:39
Most companies are.
right.
Vikram Mahidhar 03:40
Right? So any progress even if it is 50%, it's pretty awesome, right? It's 50% and then gather
more data and start enriching it.
Barry Libert 03:49
And you talk to you also about the fact which I also think is fantastic finding owners for
these projects because if you have the data - hopefully companies do, and they do as they
begin to create data lakes and they know where to find the algorithms, you said, gee, we
need to be able to find owners of these projects to ensure their success.
Vikram Mahidhar 04:04
Yeah, it's critical. Most of the times people think that first of all, people think that AI is
technology. AI is not technology. AI is math. It's a different way of doing that. And the
domain expertise, which is whether it is a business process, that of business expertise plays a
vital role. Because if you do that math wrong, you got the business wrong. Right. Right.
Barry Libert 04:29
We see that all the time
Vikram Mahidhar 04:31
So the key is that the business has to own it. I've seen in most cases where business owns it
and adopts it The success is right there.
Barry Libert 04:43
Fantastic.
Vikram Mahidhar 04:44
Okay? So that's, that's, you know, that's rule number one. Number two is when it comes to
collaboration, you know, obviously, you know, your your technology organization becomes a
big pillar there because they are going to provide you access to the data, etc. But then also
one would say then well do I need tons and tons of data scientists or, you know, AI experts
to analyze this data? I would say you don't need tons actually, you know, data analyst and
data and AI experts are the most scalable, some of the most scalable skills. But the key is
that once you start solving one problem, think about creating the data pipeline, right? And
what I mean by pipeline is, let's say that you're analyzing an invoice my earlier example
you're analyzing to match quantity and price.
Barry Libert 05:34
Yes
Vikram Mahidhar 05:34
Well there are 17 other elements on that invoice: timestamps, the date stamp, you know, the
location, you know, the carrier, the trade lane, whatever it is, you should capture all that
data and that is your data pipeline. Because next time when you want to analyze and come
up with, say, a logistical planning problem, you have all these data sets. That's one piece of
it. The second piece of it is models because it's all about models you got to maintain the
library of all those models. So the next time you're not reinventing the wheel, and that's right
there - the scalability. I would say that, you know, so I talk about this in three steps. First mile
problem, which I described, framing the problem. In between, which is how do you really
deploy? So I talked about data, pipeline, etc. But there's a last mile problem. And I think,
which is extremely important. If you cannot, and do not have the ability to put all these
algorithms in production, right, you will never be able to succeed. So it's very important that
whenever you plan for solving these different business problems that I talked about plan on
day one, how are you going to put it in production because it may require different
architecture, it may require different way of planning on how you're going to feed the data
and how you're going to take the insights out or it may require actually very different way of
adopting it from process standpoint. So it's very critical to plan for that last month first.
Barry Libert 07:05
Fantastic! Thank you very much for joining us today.
Vikram Mahidhar 07:07
Thank you Barry
Barry Libert 07:08
Look forward to seeing you again.
Vikram Mahidhar 07:09
Appreciate being here.

第一条规则关于数据
1.数据很重要
调查纯粹是一手资料研究和观点相关的内容。
云端数据使得数据与应用分离
SAP数据库
这些数据湖的目的是“将所有变量的所有部分整合在一起，然后找出驱动业务的洞察”
关键不在于将数据放入 SAP HANA 中，然后访问它。关键在于真正审视业务问题，提出正确的业务问题，然后正确地构建解决方案。
关键在于真正审视业务问题，提出正确的业务问题，然后正确地构建解决方案。明白吗？我之所以非常强调这一点，是因为我遇到的 95% 的项目都失败了，就是因为他们没有正确地构建问题
“我拥有正确的数据吗？”我不需要大数据，小数据也可以，但我拥有正确的数据吗？如果没有，那么，我应该使用什么算法技术来实际分析这些低密度数据，或者找出数据中的漏洞并填补这些漏洞？
2.交互获得新数据
推出一个MVP（最小可行产品），然后
收集更多数据，为这些数据创建更多“钩子”，对吧？这就是数据准备工作。现在，另一个非常重要的部分，大多数公司都忽略了，那就是交互数据。
自动驾驶汽车，在上路之后，他们开始收集更多数据，并利用这些数据，让汽车的驾驶性能更加精准。

第二条规则是，当谈到协作时，你的技术部门显然会成为重要的支柱，因为他们会为你提供数据访问权限等等。但另一方面，有人会问，那我是不是需要大量的数据科学家或者人工智能专家来分析这些数据？我认为实际上并不需要那么多，数据分析师、数据和人工智能专家是最可扩展的技能之一。但关键是，一旦你开始解决一个问题，就要考虑创建数据管道，对吧？我所说的“管道”是指，假设你正在分析一张发票，就像我之前举的例子一样，你分析的是数量和价格的匹配。
第二部分是模型，因为一切都与模型有关，你必须维护所有这些模型的库。

# 2.1.1.Video: Data is Essential to AI
Data is an essential part of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
And it's especially important for platform business models.
So as you understand a platform business model has cycles of value creation and value consumption
generated by the company and the networks and partners that they work with.
All of those different parties need AI to support what they're doing on the platform.
And of course, AI makes use of data.
So as the platform, the networks and the companies are all interacting together, they're creating
a wealth of data and that data is used as a product by itself and it's used to better
inform the platform through use of artificial intelligence, machine learning applications.
Data enables all the important things that happened on a platform that keep, that create
value.
It enables curation customization, matching of buyers and sellers.
For users, it allows them to improve their preferences to track trends to track usage,
and help the company encourage the best behavior out of its producers and consumers.
For the company it can help track inventory, it can drive strategy, it can create new experiments
to see what works better for the company and the users.
It can even track misuse and help companies identify suboptimal or even criminal use on
their platforms.
If we were to think, for example, about Facebook and the problems they have had with phony
accounts and manipulation on the platform.
AI is certainly one of their strategies to help combat that going forward.
So AI is important for any platform organization, any platform application and data is what
enables AI to do its job.
So given the complexity and the many moving parts on platform businesses, no company can
manage all of those in interactions and all of those transactions itself and artificial
intelligence must be a part of the equation.
So what is machine learning or AI really doing?
At its heart it's replacing the activities of human beings.
As human beings in our personal lives and in our professional lives we make decisions
all day long.
We use input data specific to the instance we apply our experience.
And we come to a decision using our intuition, our knowledge, and frankly, however we feel
that day, to be honest.
Well, machine learning is essentially creating an artificial intelligence that can make those
same types of decisions and just like people, we need data and experience to make good decisions,
so do AI's.
AI's use input data and training data in order to create the right output and both those
input data and training data pieces need to be carefully considered by any organization
that's trying to create an artificial intelligence.
Both of those pieces need to be thoughtfully and carefully put together.
One of the most important elements of a successful machine learning application is the training
data.
And the training data is really the insight that allows the machine to learn the information
it needs in order to make good decisions.
So for example, we have a wonderful application here of a machine learning tool that's trying
to distinguish parrot or guacamole.
As you can see from the pictures, there's quite a lot of overlap in terms of color,
shape, size for these parrot and guacamole pictures.
In order to create the training data to teach an AI how to do this, some person likely is
going to have to go and label thousands of pictures as either parrot or guacamole and
then as a part of the machine learning process.
The AI will reveal all those pictures look at different characteristics among them and
try to parse out what colors, what shapes, many different imaging processing elements
but which ones are associated with parrots and which ones are associated with guacamole?
To have training data, you're really creating the gold standard for what good looks like
on this decision.
Now, this is specific to supervised machine learning.
But most of the applications that companies are building today are supervised learning
applications trying to replicate decisions that human beings make today.
For example, Wealthfront and Betterment are creating decisions that essentially replace
financial advisors for a set of users.
The training data is the other piece that has to be included for successful machine
learning and the training data.
The training data includes all the features that are going to be used to build a predictive
model.
So for example, the training data for this parrot versus guacamole application might
examine the proportion of red to green, it might look for edge detection, point detection,
it might look for the circular eye shape of parrots and all of those different things
need to be turned into hard data that the machine learning tool can then associate with
either parrot or guacamole.
So the input data and the training data create sort of a heavy load for the company in order
to create an artificial intelligence.
It requires a great deal of upfront investment to get this data, right, and a lot of thoughtfulness
around what's the problem we're trying to solve?
What does good look like in decision making for this problem?
And what is the world of input data that either a person or an artificial intelligence would
need to consider in order to come to that correct decision?
So at Openmatters, which is our AI startup, we have had to create a similar application.
One of our key deliverables is the ability to look at a company and determine what its
business model is.
So whether it uses things, services, money, technology, or platforms to create value for
its customers.
And in doing so we've had to consider both of these important pieces.
The first is the training data.
So we had to look at each company and decide for ourselves what the gold standard business
model was for that company - reading annual reports, looking at the websites and determining,
does this company deal in technology?
Or do they deal in physical assets?
The second piece is the input data.
And we've had to look far beyond the typical business metrics that are available to us.
Most of financial reporting today is based on physical goods or services businesses.
And when it comes to technology, or platforms, there aren't standard metrics.
Companies do not report on how many people participate in their networks, shared Value
between the organization and the user, daily average users is a is a good one, but not
everyone reports on that.
So all of those pieces we've had to create ourselves, cobbling together different sources
in order to build a data set that the AI can actually use as input data to make good decisions
about a company's business model.

机器学习或人工智能究竟在做什么呢？
其核心是取代人类的活动。
作为人类，我们在个人生活和职业生涯中，整天都在做决策。
我们使用特定于我们应用经验的输入数据。
我们根据直觉、知识，以及坦率地说，我们当天的感受来做出决定。

机器学习的本质是创造一种能够做出同样类型决策的人工智能。就像人类一样，我们需要数据和经验来做出正确的决策，
人工智能使用输入数据和训练数据来创建正确的输出，任何试图创建人工智能的组织都需要仔细考虑这些输入数据和训练数据。
这两部分都需要经过深思熟虑和谨慎的整合。
成功的机器学习应用最重要的要素之一是训练数据。
训练数据实际上是一种洞察力，它使机器学习到所需的信息，从而做出正确的决策。

所有这些部分都必须我们自己创建，拼凑不同的来源，
以便构建一个数据集，让人工智能能够将其用作输入数据，从而对公司业务做出正确的决策。

Level 2 headings may be created by course providers in the future.

# 2.1.3.Discussion Board: Data is Essential to AI
Share in the discussion forum what AI you most value that you interact with on a daily basis (think of apps and platforms you use).

# 2.2.1.Video: Data Focus and Prioritization
So in order to participate in the AI revolution, and to use AI as a support for platform businesses,
companies need new sources of data.
And what's really remarkable about this is you and I are the manufacturers of this data.
Just take a look at how much data is generated in 60 seconds on the internet.
And this is all activities that we generate ourselves, what movies we watch, what tweets
we send, what photos we Instagram, who and what we talked about, on messenger, our connections
on LinkedIn, the music we listen to on Spotify, our lives now happen online and on our phones.
And all of those activities create data.
And that data is incredibly valuable for the companies that collect it and have permission
to use it.
And they use the data both to support the business models, in the cases where we're
not, we're not paying for the service, but also they use the data to make the service
better - to better suit us and the activities that we're participating in every day.
What's key here is the growth of alternative data.
So traditional data, financial reporting tends to be around hard physical assets and services.
So we track labor costs, and we track inventory.
We track plant property and equipment...
What we do not track as well, or the products of our mind and our relationships.
So although people count patents, what we don't do is, is sort of value r&d well, we
don't value ideas, and we don't value our relationships and networks.
But when you look at the components of the S&P market value, there has been an enormous
shift over the past 50 years.
So, you know, in 1975, traditional data was about 85% of market value.
And today, it's completely flipped.
And alternative data into tangible assets are what make up the bulk of company's value.
In order to participate, you need to have information you need to have data in the alternative
data space.
So data is becoming very rich, we have all these traditional data sources that we've
measured for 40 or 50 years, GAP accounting has driven what's included and it's been based
on what businesses were doing, which is mostly manufacturing and selling stuff, and how are
they financing that?
The new data sources are all around people, technology and networks.
Now, many companies are trying to enter the AI space focused on traditional data, and
they're playing with the exact same data sets that everybody else is, and that's not a winning
strategy.
The companies that are really creating something new and beneficial are finding new data sets
around people, right?
perhaps benefits, workforce agility, the sentiment of customers and employees, technology, IP
creation, software, and networks, a number of relationships and shared value.
And these data sources are what's creating a difference for platform companies today.
Luckily, there are many new sources of data, the amount of big data created by the world
is growing exponentially.
And there's all these different places that we can look for data.
So the baseline, of course, is corporate data, the things that companies report to the SEC
regularly and that are essentially standardized.
But on top of that, we're growing all these new sources, the data from human beings, right,
which we can gather and analyze the data from our activities online, and our interactions
with websites and marketplaces and also data from real world sensors, the Internet of Things.
All of those pieces are combining to create this wealth of new data that companies are
using to feed into artificial intelligence.
We now have zettabytes of data, just an enormous amount of data, and it's only growing now
most of this data is currently unstructured.
And what that does is it provides - it poses a challenge to companies that want to use
it.
And that's why the data process is really the most rigorous and difficult part of the
whole process of creating artificial intelligence.
Most of the energy goes into finding, structuring, and cleaning data.
Once you have great data, the great ML part is easy.
So in order to participate in this market, and to participate in machine learning companies
need to invest in the creation and maintenance of alternative data.
Now, what's great is that most organizations have this data available to them.
They just haven't been tracking it and managing it in an active way.

# 2.3.1.Video: Finding, Generating, and Managing Data
Now we're going to dig in a little bit to what it really takes to find, generate and
manage data.
One thing that many people miss is beginning with a unique hypothesis.
Lots of companies want to take the data that's easily available to them and apply machine
learning to it.
We call that AI something, something - I want to do AI.
I don't know exactly what I want to do.
But this is the data I have.
So I'll figure out what the application is that works to match the data.
Unfortunately, everybody in the world is playing with the same publicly available data sets.
So if you're creating an AI that uses input data, and training data that's available to
everyone in the world, your output is not going to be valuable, it will not be differentiated.
And that's why you can think of this happening in financial markets.
Everybody is very excited about these AI curated ETFs and hedge funds.
It's very important that those use alternative data, because otherwise, they're simply churning
around and trying to create new insights out of the same data that's available to the market,
and nobody's going to win playing that game.
So to do a successful ML application, you need to have a unique hypothesis or unique
decision piece of IP that you would like the AI to replicate.
And data management is absolutely the key to artificial intelligence.
The steps that are in blue here all have to do with managing your data.
And each one is an important and sometimes difficult step - sourcing the data, figuring
out its strengths and weaknesses, cleaning it, creating metadata to add additional value
on top of that data, connecting it to other data sources and storing it.
Once you have all of that working well, you can start designing AI, but all of the data
management is typically about 80% of the timeline.
And of course, once you have your ML working, you'll see the output, and you'll probably
realize the problems with your data, perhaps one feature is creating an outsize result
or you've identified something that's not scaled appropriately with the rest of the
data set.
Or you realize you need an entirely new data set to bring an insight to the machine learning.
So you're going to end up repeating this process again.
So just just remember that data is key.
Everybody always says garbage in garbage out, what they don't realize is the difficult work
that goes into turning data from garbage to gold.
Data sources exist all around us.
But we always have to remember to seek out those alternative and new data sources.
So we've seen this with many companies we've partnered with before, they have a unique
insight that they want to bring to the market in a scalable way using machine learning,
but they need new data to do it.
So companies have internal data, often relevant to their particular point of view.
They have sales data, customer data, data on their manufacturing, and employees.
And then in the world, of course, there's many external data sources available to people,
sometimes at a cost.
But branding, social media stock price, there's data brokers everywhere, and all of those
sources of data can come together to create value.
There's a lot of free data sets on the market as well.
And we have here a couple examples, 538 for politics, financial times for stock data,
and you can even scrape data, which is essentially extracting pure data from websites.
So there's these many different sources, but they take a little work to get them together.
And remember that no data set is perfect.
And lots of transformation has to happen before data is useful.
And that's not the sort of activity that you can just put on the technical team.
Many of these questions require business insight and knowledge to make the right decision on.
So, for example, if your data is missing values you need to figure out do we eliminate those
rows?
Do we fill them with zeros?
Do we fill them with averages?
That's something that open matters, we've encountered a lot.
Given the variance and financial reporting.
What do we do when a company is missing key values that our artificial intelligence wants
to use to determine business model, we have to identify the right process.
And it's specific to our industry and to our mission.
When companies have outlier values, what do you do?
Do you exclude them?
Do you smooth them do correct by hand, all of these decisions require business knowledge.
When there's large discrepancy between between variables.
So for example, we are often trying to compare companies like Ford to startups, they have
very different reporting, they have very different scale in their revenue, we have to figure
out how to normalize those values, so that we can look at the companies across the same
lens.
Or irrelevant and redundant features that features which is the input data, the features
that you put in your model are so important to determining what the output is going to
look like, you want to be sure to include all the features necessary for any person
to make a good decision on that key output or key decision point, but nothing redundant
and nothing irrelevant, that might buy us the model.
So all of these decisions require a collaboration between an informed business team person and
a highly skilled data technology person.
Then the next challenge combining data sets.
Most great AI applications use multiple data sets and put them together in a new way.
So for example, with our application, trying to figure out the business model of a company
at open matters, we use the SEC data from annual reports.
But we want to combine that as well with the language of investors of CEOs.
And what we see on social media, we have to figure out a way to match those two things
together.
So you know, when it comes to financial reports, we have a company name, we have a ticker perhaps
we have stock identifiers like ISIN and CUSIP, that data is not associated with Twitter.
So we have to find a smart and scalable way to match data from annual reports with data
from Twitter or from investor reports, and finding those identifiers and creating the
right matches is a real challenge.
So for all of these things, you're going to need a data management specialist.
Because on each of these decisions, there are best practices and there are best approaches
that as a business leader, you're not going to be aware of your insight will be absolutely
important to this process.
But you will also need a really well informed technology specialist in data and ML to create
a successful application.
The next thing to think about is how to use data responsibly.
And this should be front of mind for everyone.
given many things that are happening in the market.
We have new restrictions and regulations around data compliance.
For example, those of the European Union, we have ongoing security breaches with network
companies, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo, have all been hacked, right in the security breaches
are certainly not good for brand.
And then we have ethical considerations, what is a fair way to use data that reflects the
thoughtfulness you want to have about your customers, your employees and your shareholders,
you know, balancing the needs of the company with the privacy and the want of those around
us.
So every company needs to have a data policy that they carefully think of that responsibly
that reflects the responsibility they had in owning that data.
And it's important to realize as well that alternative data can be especially sensitive.
Alternative data is what the company gathers through interactions with employees, with
customers with the market and people don't always even realize when alternative data
is being collected.
It's usually not intended to be used as a data source and it has to be transformed a
little bit in order to fit into our data mold.
The standards of use and the rules around it are not always clear.
So an organization that's gathering or purchasing and using alternative data needs to be very
thoughtful and hold themselves to a high standard in order to not get in trouble for the use
of that data.

# 2.3.3.Knowledge Check: Finding, Generating and Managing Data

# 2.4.1.Video: Integrating Data into Products
Data completely changes the way that companies create and manage their
products and what it does is it creates this wonderful virtuous cycle. You
start with adding more data and then through experimentation and artificial
intelligence, that data whether gathered from customers or online applications
creates new and better products. Those products then attract more customers and
those customers generate more data and the cycle continues, and you see this
virtuous data cycle is what really differentiates a company like Amazon
from a company like Macy's or Walmart because Amazon actually has data built
into their product development cycle. Our ability to use data is improving. The
traditional algorithms that we've used for machine learning and artificial
intelligence have been around many years but they began to Plateau and we found
that even adding more data, the artificial intelligence didn't perform
better. Over the past decade, we've really delved into a new area called
deep learning which actually mirrors the brain and it's layers of artificial
intelligence pieces just like our brains have levels of neurons, and using deep
learning, artificial intelligences are able to perform better and AI has
proliferated into all these different applications such as, you know, figuring
out: Will an applicant repay alone what ads are most likely to be clicked on
what's the fastest route home, are there any faces or cats or muffins
in this picture or even in the medical industry; what does this CT scan tell me?
In all of these areas, AI is starting to replace some of the thinking that a
human being used to do. In fact, AI is becoming so important that MIT recently
created an endowment specifically for artificial intelligence, a school devoted
to helping people learn these new capabilities because they're in such
high demand. When we use data in organizations, it's not just a new way,
it's actually better. So, as I mentioned, if you would compare Macy's to
Amazon, technology can be an enablement to do what you're doing already just a
little bit faster just a little bit better or technology can be a core
capability which completely changes the way you offer products and services and
the way you iterate on them. That's why, if you take a historical retail
company and you just put their business online it's not going to be that same
dramatic fast growing and data driven company. The last thing to mention is
that no matter what your business is, AI is important. It's true if you're in the
physical business of boxes, tractors, oil and it's true if you're in the digital
business of software. Either way, artificial intelligence is key. You can
see here that John Deere has already integrated artificial intelligence into
their products and services, Amazon uses it to navigate their robots through
warehouses and it's going to be infiltrating all parts of the market. As
you're building out an AI capability in your organization, just remember, you
don't want to distribute AI around your different business units and the reason
is that each business unit probably won't have enough need to drive a truly
cutting-edge AI team. It's better to create an AI capability as a center of
excellence in the organization and have it serve different business units across
the across the org, and that's the best way to attract top talent and to create
a real differentiated offering. When you're looking at the strategies for
using artificial intelligence, always remember, there are many choices here,
there are many paths forward but most companies get stuck in optimizing.
They're doing the same thing they used to do, just slightly more digitally, maybe
a little bit faster, maybe a little bit more error proof but it's not the new
platform based business that's truly driving differentiated results. That's
where people need to target if they want that great growth and value trajectory.

# 2.5.2.Knowledge Check: Integrating Data into Products

# 2.6.1.Video: Steps to a Data Strategy
If you want to become a data-driven organization that really uses data to
support artificial intelligence you're going to have to do a few things
differently. The first is you need to create new capability in your
organization. You need machine learning experts, data managers, data warehouses.
All of that talent probably isn't in your current org but needs to be
somewhere. Now the best place to put this is in its own Center of Excellence its
own unit where it can serve different business units in all of their AI
applications. You don't want to sprinkle your talent out among the different
business units where they can't really come together and create a snowball
effect of data and artificial intelligence. The second thing you're
going to need to do is start thinking about your data, identify what you have
that's differentiated. We've talked about traditional data which is things and
money, but you need to focus on alternative data sources, people
technology and networks. You need to identify where you have something unique
in the space and how you can protect it and leverage it. The third thing to do is
begin creating some small applications and the easiest place to start is by
automating something humans already have done, so rather than trying to create
something brand new or use AI in a place where you really don't even know what
good looks like, the best thing to do is to start by automating something, a
process, that people do that you know very well then once you have that
baseline capability you can start extending and innovating. Finally,
don't forget to combine this with platform strategy, the the business model
that's truly creating a differentiated result is an open ecosystem, data at the
bottom, artificial intelligence on top and then finally served up to a network
and that's what's really creating these wonderful virtuous cycles for
organizations.

SPEAKERS
Barry Libert, Vikram Mahidhar
Barry Libert 00:01
Hi! Back here again with Vikram Mahidhar regarding AI, machine learning and data in your
organization. Thanks for coming again today.
Vikram Mahidhar 00:18
Thanks Barry! Thanks for having me.
Barry Libert 00:19
So last time, we talked about data and your three step process and algorithms in
production. Today, I want to talk about, how does it change the architecture and design of
a business and I'm hoping you can tell me about - do companies have to redesign their
strategies and their approaches and their leadership? So maybe give me some thoughts
about business design as a result of some of your prior comments. A fantastic question,
Barry. I think the implications are at three layers - Great.
Vikram Mahidhar 00:46
And I would actually start with the business process layer. Whenever we are thinking about
solving a particular problem using AI machine learning, in my experience, we have seen
process simplification as the first step. It happens by design, and I would highly encourage
leaders and executives to think about and not be afraid of process redesign. Don't think
about replacing a human being with AI, that's the wrong way to think about it, because AI
can do a lot more than human beings, and in some cases, it can do lot less. So you got to be
careful about that. The second piece here is about leadership. The leadership has to think
about it from both, you know, business standpoint as to how are they going to simplify the
business processes. Second thing they really need to think about is the human and machine
interaction and improving themselves and growing their customer. How - not just the
customer or the employees are going to get signal from the AI machine learning algorithm,
but how are they going to feed back into those it's very critical that interaction data
capture, because that makes algorithms as well as the whole value proposition of the AI
much richer. Then the third piece is the technology architecture. Many organizations today
use legacy systems and there's nothing wrong with it and I would not advocate ripping
them apart, they're working great, go for it. However, figure out how we're going to
operationalize that machine learning algorithm so that it can feed the algorithm from the
legacy system correctly and feed back into the legacy system. And then if you are doing at
a very different scale, in terms of AI and ML implementation, then you got to think about
the architecture completely differently. And you got to remember that it is not like 10 years
ago where, you know, these implementations take, you know, five years and millions of
dollars. Many of these implementations are now very quick and far less expensive. than
what it used to.
Barry Libert 03:01
Fantastic. So and my question goes to next layer, which is you have to add for that product
companies and services companies are under attack, basically, whether it be retailers or
healthcare organizations are financial services firms and automation like robo-advisors.
And the data those create are fundamentally changing the economics of organizations and
industries. So how do you see businesses themselves moving from Business Process
Automation through really organizational redesigned, you see this having an impact on
corporate strategy?
Vikram Mahidhar 03:30
I absolutely see that. I very much see that because the fundamental benefit of AI is going to
be empowering leaders with intelligence - not just insight, more intelligence and what that
means. And it's not just intelligence, which is one time project that was given to somebody,
it's continuous mining of this data and you're continuously getting that intelligence. Which
actually helps you create better instinct will be better, you know, you are more intuitive in
terms of making these decisions. Now Barry, let me give you an example here: We, for one of
the clients, we actually created a system where we are mining hundred thousand sources of
information every single hour of the day to create understanding around market and and
business implications market developments and business implications of that on financial
viability of a company and by the way we started giving them signals around it so that their
sales force is better equipped before walking into the client. And they are better, more
knowledgeable, about the customer and that had direct impact on their sales.
Barry Libert 04:51
One last question for today. Part of this autonomous and AI activity has an impact as me
and as a customer as well because I'm going to be smart about what I want and how I want
it. So do you see that having an impact on the consumer side of the world as well?
Vikram Mahidhar 05:06
Absolutely.
Barry Libert 05:06
Can absolutely explain to me what that means?
Vikram Mahidhar 05:08
Personal example, this past Christmas, I bought eight Alexa's.
Barry Libert 05:13
Eight!?
Vikram Mahidhar 05:13
Eight.
Barry Libert 05:14
Fantastic.
Vikram Mahidhar 05:15
And my primary goal was, other than making my kids happy, to collect data on myself and
our family (with their permission) and just to understand how it works. But now actually the
use of that conversation interface in my household has skyrocketed. For example, I get
recommendations on say, say last month I ordered paper towels.
Barry Libert 05:44
Yeah.
Vikram Mahidhar 05:45
Using Alexa. A month later, I get a reminder that do you need more paper towel?
Barry Libert 05:49
That's great, right? Yep.
Vikram Mahidhar 05:51
For some people, it may be annoying... But think about the convenience of it. Right? I have a
personal assistant that is keeping track of inventory in my household without me having to
bother about it.
Barry Libert 06:04
I love it. I love it. So thank you very much for joining me today. So I look forward to our next
conversation.
Vikram Mahidhar 06:10
Thank you so much, Barry.

What is one step you could take in the next quarter that would improve your current company’s data strategy?

# 2.7.1.Video: Wrap Up: Data for AI
So we've been talking about data and why data is essential for artificial intelligence and
really data is the key to platform business models.
Leaders who are looking to introduce these business models to their organizations must
value data, understand where to collect it, and how to take care of it and use it for
artificial intelligence.
There's a great shift happening in the data market, from traditional data to alternative
data.
And there's a great new skill set around managing data that everybody on the market is looking
for these days.
So any leader who wants to bring machine learning and platforms to their company need to invest
in this space, both in skills and in content.

# 任何公司成为数据驱动型组织所需的一些要素

# Module 3: Platforms & Networks, Incomplete section
So we're going to talk about the platform business model and why it's making such a
huge difference in the marketplace today.
The first thing we're going to talk about is the platform culture.
And we often call this the selfie culture.
And it's the reason that people are moving to platforms with great velocity and what
that has to mean for culture.
We're going to talk about the evolution of business models from historic legacy business
models based on physical assets up to today, where business models are based on intangible
assets, things like ideas, data, software, and networks.
We're going to talk about the asset types that underlie all these different business
models and the economics of these business models; why some perform better than others,
particularly return on assets, profitability and market value.

Sarah Swann 00:41
So, Amsale has been in business for over 30 years she is well known for her to vital gowns
and bridesmaids dresses. We design everything get our studio in New York and in April
Amale passed away. So that was the beginning of our transformation.
Megan Beck 01:04
And how long did the company been operating prior to pass
Sarah Swann 01:08
Over 30 years.
Megan Beck 01:09
So a very long legacy
Sarah Swann 01:11
Yeah intense.. Amsale was widely credited as the inventor, the modern wedding dress, like in
the 80s where she first launched, she created this beautifully simple, timeless and elegant
gown in a time where dresses were big and poofy. And that's where her DNA really made it
made its mark so Amsale was known for her light, powerfully simple designs.
Megan Beck 01:45
Dresses for the modern woman.
Sarah Swann 01:46
Totally right.
Megan Beck 01:47
And today, the modern woman and the modern buyers is changing.
Sarah Swann 01:51
Absolutely and that's what really made us where we are today with our DNA. Amsale, we've
S
M

M

M
S
Amsale Interview Page 2 of 6 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
had DNA of being purposely simple. We now want to create the purposely simple wedding
platform.
Megan Beck 02:06
And so what does that mean?
Sarah Swann 02:07
So we let a number of things that we're experiencing in the industry. We are product driven
company and we have brick and mortar stores, we don't sell online and we were noticing
the bride's feeling overwhelmed all this information coming in from Pinterest, Instagram,
shopping online. And we're also seeing the change in our retail landscape as well. As you
know, more and more stores were moving online, we wanted to build something that
created an ecosystem and a collaboration with our retail stores and with the bride and
bring it all into one platform as one journey and experience.
Megan Beck 02:57
So this is called Amsale By You. Right?
Sarah Swann 03:00
Yeah.
Megan Beck 03:00
And I love that name because it's the perfect marrying of the consumer who wants to be
more active in their - in all of their experiences, wedding and vacation and everything and
the product brought together which is really elegant. And so you mentioned four pillars;
what are the four pillars?
Sarah Swann 03:18
So I'm the other pillars apart from the AI merchandies is our enhanced Ecommerce and
where we'll be building out is from Ecommerce products so we will be selling our own
product online and we will also be building out a virtual show room where the whole entire
bridal party can communicate and also with Amsale by you. This also will give us on our
Ecommerce a customizable experience for the bride. So more convenient choice for her.
And also within the site itself. It will give us a platform where we can bring in our network
M
S
M
S
M
S
Amsale Interview Page 3 of 6 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
and our community onto the platform. So we will be providing services of if you're the
perfect Amsale bride, you've got the product now we're going to show you services where
you can book the photographer, the wedding planner, the florist, and it's a one stop shop
experience.
Megan Beck 04:28
All within that modern and simple bride aesthetic to really suit the Amsale bride.
Sarah Swann 04:33
Um, we want my every touch point to touch Amsale's DNA. So everything will be purposely
simple. So from check out to how you the journey for the entire side, another pillar to
connect as in collaborate with our retailers. We are building out a partner program. And this
is a simple mobile app that incentivized the retailer. So, as a customer enters their store they
can log in the detail into the app and we will be able to track that brides experience. So if
she decides to buy from us online, we will give the partner commission.
Megan Beck 05:20
Oh that's so important because it's often a delicate balance as companies move online with
all those existing relationships.
Sarah Swann 05:25
Exactly, and that was really important to us. Amsale was big on relationships and she spent
30 years building like over 250 retailers and 30 International so, we want to support that
relationship. We just don't want to shift. Yeah, no, remember..
Megan Beck 05:43
We're going to the clourd.
Sarah Swann 05:44
Yeah, exactly. And then everyone's like, what happens everywhere? I just went online. And so
that's very important to us. And the fourth pillar is our marketplace. So again, to unify
divides experience we want to build the first upscale bridal marketplace experience online.
So where we don't produce the product, our own product we will build it out in our
marketplace. So we've given you the dress and the bridesmaid so this will give us an
M

S
Amsale Interview Page 4 of 6 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
opportunity to give shoes, jewelry,
Megan Beck 06:26
Headpieces
Sarah Swann 06:27
Yeah, experiences. And it also gives us again, another experience to bring those vendors into
our retailers and create concept stores within.
Megan Beck 06:39
So on the strategy piece, then, you know, you've talked about moving to platform and
there's a lot of different elements there, right. There's partnerships there's data I love the
step that you've taken to digitize all the patterns a wealth of data that you had internally
already. What about artificial intelligence? Does that factor into your journey?
Sarah Swann 06:59
Yes definitely - and I think Amsale By You is kind of our first step into learning about the will
also spending time internally we as we producing our own physical product, trying to bring
in more technology into that process. What else can support us in our developments: made
to measure, CAD systems, 3D body scanning, which will help us you know, Amsale is famous
for her fit and that is something as we move online we're very conscious of that we're still
delivering that top spec. So we've been looking into how do we get that measurement? how
do we still get the perfect fit for that boy even if she's ordering online? So the 3D body scan
I'm in a something that will be vital into that.
Megan Beck 08:04
I can't wait to see how that works.
Sarah Swann 08:06
Yeah, that's a lot of research right now.
Megan Beck 08:10
That's great. And then what about operations How has your day to day changed?
M
S
M
S
M
S
M
Amsale Interview Page 5 of 6 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
Sarah Swann 08:14
Um, massively! So, you know, really my previous role working along Amsale we would, you
know, I'd be working to, you know, produce the collections alongside her managing the
design team managing the CAT calendar, producing runway shows, producing creative
shoots. And now it's like producing technology. So it's like a different day-to-day. But I'm
finding it totally fascinating to learn about what can make this entire experience just more
beautiful and less overwhelming for the bride. And it also is exciting for us from a product
point of view, because we have a platform now where anything that we can create can live.
And it's also for us a platform where we can build our network as well. We have all these
connections within the industry. And it's kind of like keeping it all in your little black book,
but now they have somewhere to live and we can all collaborate.
Megan Beck 09:31
Yeah,
Sarah Swann 09:32
So that's very exciting for us.
Megan Beck 09:35
That's a great theme of taking these intangible assets, these assets that companies have
organizations and particularly one that was relationship driven from the start and actually
turning them into a really great piece of value equation. That's wonderful. Well, Sarah, thank
you for sharing with us the story of Amsale and and how you're going to be changing over
probably the next 10 years.
Sarah Swann 09:56
Yes, definitely. Thank you.
Megan Beck 09:58
Thank you.

# 3.1.1.Video: Platform Culture

There's something interesting happening in the market today.
And it's a mix of technology, business and us the culture that we create.
And things are changing a little bit.
And what is happening is that what we want in the world, and what we're able to achieve
is different.
We want this magical set of things to be easy, immediate, personal, shareable and independent.
You're looking at the most liked picture on Instagram in 2017, we want our lives to be
all of these things.
Many technologies, platforms.
And companies are now helping us create this beautiful life that's easy, immediate, personal,
shareable and independent, driven by ourselves and our own wants.
And it's not just our personal lives, we want it professionally.
We want to be able to work for who we want to work for, when we want to work under our
own terms.
We want to be a part of a network of people who are all valued and contributing in the
way they want.
So we have here an example UpWork.
There are many, many platforms now that are enabling gig workers at all levels and at
all types from Uber to talk to your consultants to create work on their own terms.
And we want to do it with our money.
We want to control our investments.
The days of people going to a trusted financial advisor for guidance and control to hand over
control of their finances are over, and wealth front and betterment.
And many companies in the FinTech space, are creating this easy, immediate, personable
personal, independent ecosystem for us to manage our money.
So there's a real question here, what came first in the selfie economy,
our own wants, or the technologies that enable them?
There's a lot of talk about millennials and how they're different from previous generations.
The fact of the matter is, Millennials are simply better at using technology to create
a life that we all want personal, shareable and independent...
Beautiful.
So it's really human beings have stayed the same over time.
But there's been this enormous growth and technology and capability that's changing
the way people interact with each other with their jobs and with their money.

# 3.1.3.Discussion Board: Platform Culture
Share in the discussion forum what platforms you use most frequently and one way they have changed your life.
After posting your response, please comment on three other posts.  

# 3.2.1.Video: Business Model Evolution
There's been a dramatic change in the business models that companies are using.
And there's no better way to demonstrate it than this view of the market value of Apple
and Amazon's they're racing $2 trillion valuations much faster than legacy companies like GE,
or Ford companies that have been around for 60 years that are based in physical assets
and that seem to be following a much slower growth trajectory.
And it's platforms.
And, of course, AI and data as well that are making the difference for Amazon, and apple.
So we have this whole new world of new business models.
When you want to go out to dinner, you can source your restaurant on Yelp, when you need
to get across town, there's Uber, if you're in a new city, there's Airbnb, if you want
to entertain your children, there's YouTube, there's Twitter for keeping up with news on
any subject you want.
All of these platform companies are creating a life for us where we can have easy immediate
personal information and have our needs fulfilled on an instant basis.
So there's these platform companies, and they're emerging now, not just because of this cultural
ability, that we have this comfort, expressing our desires for all these immediate gratification
pieces, but also underlying that new technologies, the ability to quantify the world around us
to apply artificial intelligence and to serve it up on a platform.
So there's this boom of unicorns a huge startups that are growing quickly creating great value
for their investors creating outsized market caps and changing the marketplace as we know
it.
So why are they emerging now it's this mix of culture, but also technology.
And what's happening is that companies in the middle are being squeezed, really only
10% of companies on the market are even making strong efforts in the AI and technology space.
So we have the well established tech companies which had a step up in creating their platforms.
And we have the unicorns the startups who don't have the legacy of decades of infrastructure
and hard assets, holding them back and they're squeezing the bulk of the market and we're
seeing this, you know, winner take all economy that's being driven by platform growth
incumbents are playing catch up, but they're at a huge disadvantage.
Right.
So so many incumbents today are creating startups, partners, startups within the firm partnerships
taking an equity stake in these exciting platforms.
We have forward with their partnership with Lyft, GE trying to build their own industrial
platform predicts, Marcus, an automated advisor by Goldman Sachs, all of these companies are
looking for the way that they can take a stake in the platform economy that they can participate
and grow.
But they our step behind and truthfully there hampered by decades of legacy plant property
and equipment, manufacturing focus or services focus.
We have this evolution from the industrial age all the way to the platform age that companies
are struggling to navigate the steps between.
And that's why we're here to talk about platform business models and what really matters for
creating them.
So what does it take to create a platform business model, it's a complete 180 degree
change from the perspective of businesses over the course of the last 50 years, it used
to be that an organization owned the entire process within its castle walls, you know,
from the conceptualization, the manufacturing and the delivery of the product to the customer,
it was a straight one way line, a platform business model requires an entirely new approach
to value creation.
Although the company creates managers and curates the platform, they have to have an
open attitude.
They have to allow the network to contribute value as well.
So of course, on first instinct, it would be a wonderful approach, hey, I can just create
something and everybody else is going to add all the value.
I don't have to source materials.
I don't have to manufacture I don't have to own them.
And that's what happens.
That's what happens with Uber with Airbnb with Etsy, with Pinterest, with Lyft...
All of these companies are taking a step back from needing to own the process and the product
into end and allowing an openness to come into their business model where the network
provides and consumes the value.
This requires a two sided revenue model, you can think of Uber apps, Airbnb, all of them
have two different components, two different networks that are contributing and consuming
their products.
When it comes to Uber, we have drivers and writers, and neither one of which is owned
by the company.
Apple and Google, allow others to develop apps on their platforms, which are then increasing
the value for their core products, their devices and their technologies, and increasing the
value for the users who consume those apps with Airbnb.
It's the same two sided revenue model with hosts and visitors both creating this beautiful
ecosystem of providing and consuming value.
And it completely changes the role of the organization, the company that's facilitating
this, their attitudes, their capabilities, and their measurements all have to change.
So what we have with platform business models, as as many party evolution of the firm, the
company will start with them, they create the platform.
But within the platform, there's many important components.
There's an API, which is an interface that allows some people to access different parts
of the platform and the data and the core data itself, which is where great deal of
the value is created for platform companies.
The company has access to all of this, and they're able to control the access of the
many other parties that are an important part of this ecosystem.
The producers and consumers usually only use the external interface, but that allows them
to transact with information products, services, whatever it is, it's being exchanged on the
platform.
And there's also partners, right, so think of the Facebook model where the group of worldwide
consumers is also the group of worldwide producers of content, but they also have partners, advertisers
that help fund the business.
So there's many different parties that are involved in a platform business model.
And balancing the needs of these platforms is an essential part of both the technology
and the perspective.
So that's it.
That's an overview of the platform business model and why it's so important and where
its places in the market today.

# 3.2.2.Reading: Investors Today Prefer Companies with Fewer Physical Assets
Level 2 headings may be created by course providers in the future.

# 3.2.3.Knowledge Check: Business Model Evolution

# 3.3.1.Video: New Asset Types
There's a new set of assets that are driving platform business models, and it's a completely
different approach.
Platform companies are able to use less to do more.
We can see this in almost every industry, they're using fewer assets and fewer employees
to drive greater market valuations.
We can see it in retail and transportation and in lodging where startups or Amazon platform
company are using fewer employees, fewer hard resources to create more value for investors,
employees and customers.
So here's a simple question - what has more value: my partner Barry or the chair he sits
on?
Now this is a Herman Miller Aeron chair, it's a very expensive chair, and when it comes
to companies, they value the chair more.
At any organization their physical assets are categorized as assets, while people and
many intangible assets as well (the products of their mind) are counted as cost.
This changes the way organizations manage their assets, it changes their incentives
in the marketplace, and it's one of the things that makes platform companies so difficult
to value well.
Many in the market say, "How can a company like Uber like Airbnb create these outsized
valuations?"
The key consideration to understanding that is the fact that they're putting the proper
value on their people and their intangible assets.
Our economy has been driven by physical assets.
Since the industrial age, you know, all of the great giants of 20 or 30 years ago, created
cars, oil, consumer products, all of these physical things have driven the way we've
understood companies we've measured their success and the way leaders and boards have
managed companies.
But some of these business models are becoming very outdated.
A second one is services right on top of things, companies can also offer the services of you
and me, the product of our labor, consulting, healthcare, insurance, all of these companies
are offering a people service instead of a physical good.
Finally, we took a leap, we started leveraging scalable products like money and IP and ideas.
These assets scale dramatically differently than things and people.
And ultimately, we've leveraged the most important asset of all our own networks - the relationships
between us were Facebook, Uber, Pinterest, Etsy, all of these companies are coming into
play.
And there's this dramatic change in how companies are scaled and valued.
And that's because some types of assets grow faster and more cheaply than others.
If you are manufacturing cars and you want to build a second car on top of your first
you need more steel, more time in the plant more energy.
However, if you are creating an idea, you need only to have the idea and the replication
cost is dramatically lower.
And we've seen this in software and biotech in high tech that this class of products scales
much more rapidly, once the investment the creation is done.
And finally, the fastest scaling of all are networks, because we all appreciate the value
of bringing in our friends, our family, our colleagues, to the network, we're incentivized
to help it grow, and as it grows, the value grows too.
So what we're seeing underlying the shift in business models is an incredible shift
and the types of assets that they're using to create value from things which are not
scalable through people, ideas and platforms and networks, the most scalable and valuable
of all.

# 3.3.2.Reading: Companies Are Owning Less And Creating More Value

# 3.3.3.Knowledge Check: New Asset Types

# 3.4.1.Platform Economics
Platform Companies have totally different economics than the rest of the market.
It's almost where the magic comes in.
Now, when it comes to the revenue models, the platforms use.
There's a lot of variety, right?
Facebook sells advertising, Etsy and other marketplaces often take a cut of transition
of the transactions, LinkedIn charges for upgrades, there's this multi level freemium
model, and match.com charges for access, because their users typically use the platform for
a defined period of time, not an entire lifetime.
So they're all using different ways to generate revenue for themselves.
But when it comes to their market value, they have something in common.
Now, just as a baseline, there are five business models, things companies that sell physical
goods, services, companies that sell the the services of people like you and me, technology
companies based on ideas, and IP, and then platforms based on networks.
And of course, within the middle, all of these companies rely on money.
And there are some pure plays, who simply offer money products like investment funds.
So when it comes to the economics of platform companies, and technology companies, the profile
is very different from the historical firms platform.
businesses grow faster technology firms also grow quickly.
And why this is because they're leveraging in tangible assets.
They're leveraging ideas and networks in ways that allow the company to grow with very low
return on asset and to take advantage of network effects.
So the more people who join the network, the more value is created within the network.
And then more people want to continue joining the network.
And it's this great exponential growth curve that we've seen across Instagram, Alibaba,
Facebook, and a whole suite of unicorn companies, platform business models are also more profitable.
So this fast growth and low return on high return on assets driven by intangible assets
create great profit margins.
So technology and platform companies can be highly profitable platform companies the most,
but technology companies tend to reinvest their profit very quickly, particularly in
R&D.
This is the model we've seen with Amazon where the company has barely turned a profit.
And it's because of this continual reinvestment cycle in creating new ideas for the future.
Ultimately, technology and platform companies are the most value of the market and they
crush things and people businesses, investors will pay way more for every dollar of revenue
driven by a technology or a platform company.
So when Ford generates $100 in revenue, the market the investor the investment community
pay $30, when Facebook generates $100 worth of revenue, the market pays 1400 dollars.
So what this means is that there's a great incentive for companies to embrace these platform
and technology based business models leveraging tangible assets like ideas, networks, and
relationships.
But fewer than 2% of companies are platforms and technology companies only add on a small
percentage of the overall pie.
Our world has a long legacy in industrial things based businesses and human services
based businesses.
And the shift is difficult for companies to navigate.
So although we've seen startups and some of the large technology companies enter this
space, it's really blue ocean for many services and asset based companies.
And this is why so many firms are trying to figure out how can I integrate platforms into
my business.

# 3.5.1.Video: Strategies for Platforms
Platform business models require a different strategic approach than legacy business models.
And what really matters here is the degree of openness.
So there have been platforms around for hundreds of years.
They haven't always been enabled by technology.
But you can think of social groups and matchmakers but what's happening today is that technology
is allowing platforms to have access and scale like never before.
But there are different degrees of platforms.
And this is something that we hear in the market all the time will.
Microsoft Office is a platform, Salesforce.
com is a platform and that's true, but the degree of openness matters and what we mean
here is how much control the company maintains over the activities and the products that
happen on their platforms.
If you compare Microsoft Office to Facebook, Uber and Airbnb, it's a very different business
model where the company still owns and maintains a
great deal of the product ownership and the value creation as opposed to organizations
that really open their platforms up for the access and the contributions and the thinking
of their network.
business models are not industry dependent no matter what your industry, you have intangible
assets, right.
Even the most physical industry has ideas, intellectual property, customers and employees.
So no matter where you are, you have access to the best business models.
Macy's is a historical retailer, it's a very physical asset based business.
But Amazon is also in the business of delivering physical stuff just to your door instead of
making you come to the store, but it's still a very warehouse and transport and inventory
heavy business.
But Amazon has really changed the game and the way they've done that is by incorporating
newer business models that support their retailing efforts.
So Amazon has wonderful
Technology, their website is cutting edge, they use artificial intelligence in new and
exciting ways and in fact, offer those services to their customers as a product.
And they have a marketplace, leveraging a network of sellers worldwide.
And this difference in business model, the fact that Amazon has been able to develop
a hybrid business model in service of their retail activities is the reason why Amazon
is the trillion dollar company.
So not every company can be a technology or platform based business as their primary business
model.
You know, if you are in the car industry, and you have a history of manufacturing cars,
that's going to remain for many years and that's why hybrid business models are so powerful.
Most of the most of the most exciting companies today are not pure place where they focus
entirely on things or services or technology, but they do one thing complemented by a suite
of other business models.
So although
Facebook is really a social media and a network based business.
They developed great new technologies to enable that business and to provide better service
to their customers.
And they even have entered the hardware space.
Microsoft, on the other hand, is a primarily technology based business with a lot of their
revenue coming from software, but that's complemented by physical devices, even services and then
the network component of their software as well.
So don't feel when looking at your own life, your own company that you need to make a 100%
shift to new business models.
Many companies are seeing great results by just incorporating slices of new business
models into their overall business model portfolio.
And Amazon is a wonderful example when Amazon began.
Although it was online, most of the business was very physical and they weren't really
a tech savvy company, but they have had an incredible research and development intensity
investing 5 to 10 even 15 percent of their revenue.
into research and development.
And what they've done is that's enabled them to shift their business model to grow the
pie overall dramatically by investing in technology and networks.
So you need to be thinking hybrid and this is a wonderful message.
If business model transformation seems like a huge step to take, start small, you already
have the assets in your organization, you have intangible assets.
It's just a matter of leveraging and incorporating them in order to drive new business models
in order to drive customer facing activity.
So shift towards intangible assets.
Think about the new business models that you want to create in your own organization and
how those support your mission of creating value for your customers.

So to wrap up the platform section, what we've done here is we've laid a foundation of the
knowledge leaders need in order to navigate this business model transformation that's
happening in the market.
We talked about why platforms are important, and how they address key needs that human
beings have in a way that we've never been able to do before.
We've talked about how platforms fit into the evolution of business models and how they're
supplanting historic business models based on physical assets by leveraging new types
of assets, intangible assets that make all the difference.
We've discussed why platform companies perform better and the reasons that they outperform
on revenue growth, profitability, and ultimately market value.
And then finally, we've talked about what are some strategies that leaders need to know
in order to begin implementing platform business models in their own companies.
So coming up, we're going to talk about the technologies that enable platforms the data
that's so important as a baseline, and ultimately how to transform a company and to begin creating

Barry Libert 00:09
Hi, Barry Libert here again today with Chip McLean, one of my favorite firmwide strategy
guys from Crowe.
Chip McLean 00:16
Good to see you Barry.
Barry Libert 00:17
Thanks we're happy to have you here today. So tell me a little bit about what your job is and
what is it that you do every day as part of the firm wide strategy practice?
Chip McLean 00:25
So I get to work with all the business unit leaders and their teams and vertical industry
leaders and help them think more deeply about how do we add value to our clients.

Barry Libert 00:37
And what does that mean, in English?
Chip McLean 00:40
It means we get together, we lock ourselves in rooms, and we think about what our current
business models are, and what types of things we can look at to change those business
models to add more value to help our clients make smarter decisions.
Barry Libert 00:57
Fantastic. So you and I started a process but six months ago called pivot sort of interesting
beginning. And can you take me through what you did in terms of pivot, pinpoint inventory,
validate, organized and transfers? Let me start from the beginning with the first thing you
did and I think we had an offsite meeting and you were sort of building a presentation
about how to pinpoint one's mental model, what was what's your thesis out, people should
think about that?
Chip McLean 01:24
Well, there's a challenge that you start with and that is that we've been living in business
models, you know, for a long time. And we operate within those business models. And in
order to pivot your business, you have to change the way you look at things, which is super
hard, because all of your strategy and innovation has been geared towards working within a
given business model. So people are, I don't want to say closed minded but very myopic on
how do we add value to our customers. So you you've gotta, you gotta throw a lot of that
stuff out and look at things with more of a broader lens.
Barry Libert 02:06
And you have this analogy about "seeing the stars". So maybe you can come a little bit
what you did, and how you did that, at that event.
Chip McLean 02:12
Okay, so I saw a TED talk a long time ago, and I can't even remember who delivered it. But
there's a there's a quote by Marcel Proust, that says, "the real voyage of discovery, not
seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes,". So I'm like, that's really relevant to this
whole journey that you're going to go on to pivot. And so the story I tell us, if we go out and
look at the night sky by ourselves, and we know nothing about the sky will look at it and go,
B

AI Leadership - Crowe Interview - Chip McLean.mPpa4ge 2 of 5 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
oh, they're stars. But if we go out and look at the sky with a telescope will see more than we
could see with the naked eye. And then a third way to look at it is what if I had an
astronomer with me they have more perspective. So the reality is, we all have our own point
of view, in order to advance our business model in our thinking, we have to expand our own
point of view... and that only comes from really being open to doing that.
Barry Libert 03:14
Great. And then we moved in something i thought was a great exercise you did on the
board, we sort of did an inventory to see what we could do in this firm. And I think we had
some real surprises, if I remember correctly, in terms of what we learned.
Chip McLean 03:26
Yeah, yeah, I think, you know, businesses evolve over time. And many things are done very
intentionally, but a lot of it is to meet a current business needs. So you, you evolve over time.
But we did an inventory of all of the technology solutions that we have available today. And
we ended up with, it was over 60 different sticky notes on the wall that represented all the
technologies and, and we stuck, we stepped back and there was this huge aha moment,
because we could physically see see the chaos of the journey we've been on. And so, okay,
so here's where we're at today. But the reality is, how do we support that and an ongoing
basis, and you start to look at the resources required, the, you know, just to keep the
technology up to date, everything, and we're like, oh, my gosh, this isn't this is not a
sustainable model, which is why we started working with you is to start thinking about, you
know, how can we create a common platform and leverage the relationships we have, and
ultimately bring artificial intelligence to, you know, all this amazing data and stuff that we
have to help our clients make better decision.
Barry Libert 04:46
And you also did an inventory, if I remember correctly on data, what did we find there?
Chip McLean 04:52
The same thing - I mean, we have a bunch of structured we have a bunch of unstructured
data that lives in, way too many places, and it's it's unmanageable, right? It's, we can't
harness the value in that data, because it's, we had no real data strategy. You might have a
data strategy for a solution, but maybe you're in a vertical with 10 solutions. Without a
common data strategy, you can't leverage the value that you have there. So we're in the
same same boat with data,

AI Leadership - Crowe Interview - Chip McLean.mPpa4ge 3 of 5 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
Barry Libert 05:27
Fantastic. At least we learned that, I think that was an "aha" for, I remember that day for
everybody in the room. Now, we've moved on from that period of time, you guys moved into
validation faster than any client I've ever seen. And what, how did you begin to think, oh,
gosh, I have to build a business model proposal to the board to validate that we have
something that that there's a "there there" here at Crowe?
Chip McLean 05:50
So that whole validation processes is, it's an education process, right? So you people, you
know, that haven't been on that journey with us now have to, to be able to see it in a
manner that shows that it's necessary for sustainability for the organization. But we brought
up - we have a team of 15 people that represent different facets of the firm. And we're
working on thinking about the new business model trying to validate it, we're looking at
data, we're looking at governance, we're looking at how do you, you know, take a
technology that's deployed and move it onto a platform? So all of this is part of that whole
validation process. It's answering all the questions that need to be answered before you
move to finally operationalizing going to platforms, networks and AI.
Barry Libert 06:55
And it's so cool. We started with probably 40 people in the room in the first meeting when
we, when we first started 50 people? We're down now to like a dozen, I noticed, we really
are beginning to organize a team now. Can you tell me what the different types of skills that
are emerging on this team to make it a full team?
Chip McLean 07:10
Oh, my gosh, yeah, we have everything from data scientist to software architecture type
thinking, to marketing people, to our Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, to people that
have been on our innovation teams to help us better understand the technologies that we
have out there, and the value they provide. And so it's a pretty diverse team that have
amazing amounts of experience in the stuff that we've been doing thus far. But also people
that can think about how do we transform the business to move to live in this world that we
live in.
Barry Libert 07:57
The last thing is transforming the business. It seems to me there's two pivots going on in this
firm. One is transforming the firm as it is to be more efficient, and one is creating a brand
B
C
B
C

AI Leadership - Crowe Interview - Chip McLean.mPpa4ge 4 of 5 Transcribed by https://otter.ai
new pivot model, which is a brand new business in and of itself. Can you explain to me those
two very different activities, why they're different, and how you're experiencing it differently,
in fact.
Chip McLean 08:22
So based on what I've experienced less far, would say that there's still huge value in what we
do in our traditional business model. That's never going to go away I mean never is a long
time, but we might be providing higher value as a result of some of the things will be doing
in the new business model. So there's some things that happen where, you know, you have
to anticipate making that change is hard, and not everyone's going to be completely
accepting of that and understanding of it. So there's an effort there to really effectively
educate that a traditional business model and then on the new business model pivot -
because you're really asking me about the two pivots that are happening, right? So you
have to pivot the traditional business model to think about how do we coexist in what
values do we bring to each other. And then on the on the new business model, it's a massive
pivot. On paper, it seems logical and easy, but there's so many things that have to change,
starting with mindset and how you develop solutions and in how you leverage data and how
you take things to the new world of AI. AI be the new electricity, right?
Barry Libert 10:02
Yep. Fantastic. Thanks so much. Thanks for being with me today.
Chip McLean 10:05
Alright, thanks, Barry.
Barry Libert 10:06
Appreciate it.

# 4.1.1.Video: Pinpoint

So let's get started. Let's think about for a second as we begin our journey
into pivot, the first one, pinpoint and understand where did we come from. So, as
we talked about in the beginning with Megan, the objective in today's world is
to achieve my needs. To be immediate, easy, personal, sharable and independent. Now, I
don't look like Selena Gomez nor am I as attractive or as well known, but it's
still the same. I want to have all those same capabilities, objectives met, needs
covered and to do that I need to be part of and want to be part of the gig
economy which is a company like upwork where I can get immediate, easy, personal
sharable and independent work where I can move around my money like with
wealthfront and betterment and where I can ultimately be part of a company that
understands the components of success which includes producers, consumers, data IA
and a user interface that is easy, ready, available and enables me to
achieve my goals. So as we think about each of these things, we can see why
today's most valuable companies have moved from the days of GE and GM and
Exxon which are hard, heavy, slow moving companies to today's light organizations
like Apple and Amazon and Facebook and Tencent and Alibaba where everything is
about the consumer, the partner, the partner and provider and those companies
that understand these frictionless platforms are worth upwards of a
trillion dollars and serve not one million customers, but a billion
customers and so therefore the old product service economy sits in the red
ocean whereas today's platforms, AI and data based businesses set in the blue
ocean and we need to help every one of you make the case to your leaders that
it's time to move from red ocean to blue ocean, so let's get started.
To begin with, I want to be clear what we've learned and all of our work with
boards and leaders is that the really hard thing to do is to change one
leader's or board's thinking. As Einstein once said, to break a mental model is
more difficult than literally splitting an atom and that really tells you about
the journey you're about to go on, So to recant, what has happened is we've
talked to you about the five business models: physical, human, intellectual, money
and platform and the economics of each of them so I want to spend a minute
again repeating that this is about money. It's about producing more economics for
your organization as a leader as a vice president as a director by understanding
the economics of the journey, not just the goodness of being an AI driven
platform because when it's all said and done you will need money to make this
transition and transformation, so the numbers are what you need to be able to
tell. And, you need be able to tell why this is the future for your organization.
If you're a manufacturer, which is the oldest business model if you're a
services firm which is still fairly old or even a financial services firm, you
need to move up the curve to the digital world and platform world and you will be
compensated for that. Now, as we think about it in the physical world remember
it's me making something like the chair you're sitting in and selling it to
somebody, someone who else wants to sit in a chair. In the services world, about
me selling time I'm an ex McKinsey consultant Megan's from Bain, Thomas
Accenture. We sold hours and those hours got sold one to one. In the money world, I
make something many people can use, it it's called In God We Trust, which is on
our dollar bills, but in the platform in digital we make something once many
people can participate in like Apple iOS and many people can contribute to it.
So, as you think about where you are, think about are you on the left side of
this which means are you somebody an organization
that makes something and sells it to an organization as a one-sided exchange or
are you part of the new economy, the AI platform and data economy where multiple
parties are contributing multiple sources of value to an organization that
is you, that is convening. And when you think about that, I'm going to ask you a
question in this actionable part of this course is very simply what is the gap
for your organization between a product service mental and business model that
you have today and a platform AI and data based business model that is
multi-sided, has machine learning at the center and as Megan said curates,
understands and protects the value of the data as the core premise of what you
do every day.

# 4.2.1.Video: Inventory
In this module, we're gonna look at inventory. We're gonna try to understand
what it is you currently keep track of and what it is you need to keep track of
in the platform, AI and data worlds. Now there's a high probability that there is
a very large gap between where you are and where we want you to go, but that gap
is really blue sky for you, as this picture shows. As I look and walk around
organizations, I say to every firm and board I work for, there is data strewn
throughout every organization on the floor. Customer data, employee data,
inventory data, you name it. Sentiment data, engagement data and it's
sitting all over the place but the problem is that organizations have not
valued that data, they've only valued the fundamental data of an organization. The
financial data, the manufacturing data, the productivity data of the
organization, so we're gonna try to cross the chasm and this is a big chasm for
most organizations as they look to inventory what is truly valuable as
Megan has showed in today's intangible and alternative data world. So let's
start again with where Megan left us off. We all know, because our CFO's, our chief
financial offers have been the keeper of money and things, it's now time for us to
look abroad and say where is other sources of data. So it's possible that we
think about, okay, does the HR person have people data, benefits data, engagement
data, training data, educational data, insights data about the people and
suppliers with which we work that allows us to better serve them against which we
can apply machines to improve their lives. On the other side, do we have
through our chief marketing officer network data, that is social network data,
marketing data, social responsibility data even investor reports and investor
data because they're part of our external networks. And are we collecting
from sensors IOT data, because that's external to our current internal
network and for an educational organization, do we have data regarding
our families whose service them, we serve, their children, their parents, the funders.
Do we think about that broadly and from a technology spectrum, do we have
intellectual property data like brand data, software data, patent data, you name
it. R&D investment data that shows the type of intellectual property that we
are producing. As we think about all those alternative data sets, we have to
think who owns it who's responsible for we know in the finance department who
owns that data set but do we really know who owns the data sets that we just
talked about is there somebody in our organization that we can go to to
understand what data they have what data they could and can collect and how can
that be governed in such a way it presents and delivers value for the
organization. And to do that, we need to think, okay, we need to take a data
inventory and we need you to go to the natural person in our organization that
has been the keeper of those relationships. Doesn't mean they've been
the keeper of the data sets, but they've been the keeper of those network-based
relationship marketers, HR department, production departments technology
departments and we need to understand what is the cost of not knowing. Think
about this way, there was a quality movement right Deming realized that the
cost of not knowing the quality of data for Ford or the quality of a car
produced by Ford when Ford became a simple mission on quality as job number
one is they realized that the cost of not knowing the quality of what they
produced created a lack of customer desirability, a lack of customer loyalty,
so they realized they had to know what type of car they were producing and the
quality of that car they were producing so they can maintain customers, make sure
they were satisfied and cars were now brought back into warranty, well
the same thing goes for data. Can you imagine 10 years ago, today,
you had to drive to your local educational institution or you had to go pay
a bill, or you had to go downtown and you didn't know how to get there and by
chance Google decided 'I'm taking away GPS'. You'll love to just figure out your
way there and there's no more Maps anymore,
you'd have to navigate a long way without knowing where you're going. Well,
that's the truth for organizations too. They're navigating in a not knowing way
they've not thought wow what is the cost of not knowing the GPS of our strategy,
the GPS of our customer directions, the GPS of our employees wants and needs, the
GPS of our Investor requirements. That cost is very high, so it's necessary to
do a cost-benefit analysis of not knowing versus knowing. Once you
understand that you can do the next thing under inventory, you can do
something as simple a plot like this what is available and what
can I value immediately, and in the low bottom left corner you can think, well
I've got some easy to obtain information with low impact, but what I really want
to have is hard to access information with high impact. So, how do I do that
around intellectual property? how do I do that around customers and employees and
how do I do it around brands and friendships and fans so that I could begin
to move my business from easy to access not very valuable data
to high value, high-impact, hard to access data and to make that the core of what
we do ,and that could be applications software data regarding brands, you name
it. But data is the core of what it is you're going to do around every aspect
of your business in this inventory part of our activities.
