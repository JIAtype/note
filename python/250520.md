# 项目提案：基于AI的工业生产环境安全监控系统
AI-based industrial production environment safety monitoring system

## 1. 项目背景
在工业生产环境中，工人的健康和安全是至关重要的。然而，目前的监控系统往往需要人工干预，且无法实时准确地检测工人的健康状况。因此，我们计划开发一个基于AI模型的监控系统，用于检测工人是否晕倒或长时间保持静止。

In industrial production environments, the health and safety of workers is of paramount importance. However, current monitoring systems often require manual intervention and cannot accurately detect the health status of workers in real time. Therefore, we plan to develop an AI-based monitoring system to detect if a worker faints or remains still for a long time.
